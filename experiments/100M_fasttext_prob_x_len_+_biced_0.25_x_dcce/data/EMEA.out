this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the trials conducted for human medicinal products ( CH@@ MP ) have been assessed in order to reach recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the treatment supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that are dissolved in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. enter@@ tain thoughts and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder where patients have man@@ ic episodes of abnormal mood altern@@ ating with periods of normal tuning . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick check of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to inhal@@ e or the enam@@ el tablets in patients that make the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulty . &quot;
&quot; in patients who at the same time take other medicines that are degra@@ ded as well as bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; because D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine can play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re @-@ occurrence . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent re@@ occurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to a year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occurring , to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in patients &quot; symptoms was examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body res@@ or@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg received a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than those who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of several episodes in previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy @-@ inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15@@ mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal disturb@@ ances ( un@@ controlled imp@@ etus ) , tre@@ mor ( constant movement ) , sed@@ ation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , s@@ ali@@ va ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , s@@ ali@@ va hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , s@@ ali@@ va hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , s@@ ali@@ va hyper@@ secre@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients , which were predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , when oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and discussed their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the higher sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases by beginning or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic treatment , including in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ic@@ idal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; aria pra@@ z@@ ole should be prescribed cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ work disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ oc@@ el@@ ized and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ nas@@ ties : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with abili@@ fy symptoms and symptoms of late pal@@ sy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l had an increased risk of dying compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dose , a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients dealing with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , allowing direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ is@@ ers .
considering the common dose of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to esc@@ ort therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be attributed with a moderate rise in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns arising in the animal reproduction studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l does not have any negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS increased 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic treatment include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and elevated mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors as well as an even aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D and 5@@ HT@@ 2a , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in doses ranging from 0,5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ c rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study 52 the share of respon@@ der patients who maintained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and at 57 % below the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ cone @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia for 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study enti@@ t@@ lement was &apos; weight gain &apos; , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy in reducing systemic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially applied to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the Enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ung is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the middle elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l with extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and near 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no cl@@ ue to clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on the safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , reproductive di@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) at rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 times the average ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l are not more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solv@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for delivering single doses made of aluminium in folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; 34 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; 46 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets , can take the tablets alternatively to abili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , also reported in some cases by the onset or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestation of a brain are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , altern@@ ating units of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is commonly observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients dealing with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including abili@@ fy . &quot;

92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be attributed with a moderate rise in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS increased 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ cone @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia for 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study enti@@ t@@ lement was &apos; weight gain &apos; , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in wholes@@ ome subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage . &quot;
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of acute and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under the circum@@ ference of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status considering the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if an additional oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , see the summary of the features of the medicine to abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy sm@@ elt tabl@@ etten or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with acute and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar I disorder . &quot;
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ xy@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or a blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; aria pra@@ z@@ ole should be prescribed cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ work disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ oc@@ el@@ ized and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestation of a brain are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , altern@@ ating units of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is commonly observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly used as a dispos@@ able intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly ( 2 mg dose ) at the same time . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to esc@@ ort therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that according to the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
the following side effects were reported more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic treatment include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and elevated mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of Agi@@ ok@@ iness / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as acute and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the Agi@@ or@@ rho@@ ea and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison with plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the average improvement of the starting value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe acute anxiety , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased patient count . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study 52 the share of respon@@ der patients who maintained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
&quot; current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , a significantly higher return rate was reduced , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ cone @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia for 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study enti@@ t@@ lement was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in part about 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the middle time was applied to achieving the maximum plasma pi@@ v@@ age at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and results in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dose during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) that were 15 or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cular .
&quot; in studies on reproductive drugs according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) lay over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , reproductive medicine , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ gen@@ eity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 @-@ fold the average steady @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a study on which 460 women participated in metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) , the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who breast@@ feed , or before the treatment begins , have low neutr@@ ons in the blood . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel in order to decrease side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the operation of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease , and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine therapy is not shown ( see also Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ emia &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 during the subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy Level 3 , the treatment is interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ it@@ em@@ ic formulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel with significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no further abra@@ sive cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils are increased again to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion .
&quot; while a car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is un@@ common , cardiac events are not un@@ common in the indicated patient @-@ collective , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if patients receive nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a in patients following the dose of abra@@ sive nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents . &quot;
&quot; abrasion should not be used in pregnant women or women at child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients , which are treated with abrasion , are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; before treatment , male patients should be advised about a sperm donation because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; abrasion can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
the following are the most common and most significant incidence of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of abrasion .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most distinctive ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects associated with the administration of abrasion as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in connection case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events was established . &quot;
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their depos@@ oly@@ mer .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ated the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ ose of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel with end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ bili@@ zing protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ handed un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second trial a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel for 3 weeks , either in form of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without medication ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ ases and 19 % because of metast@@ as@@ ation and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for general response rate and time to progression , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving a first @-@ line therapy are explained below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic degree 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy towards the sound of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous doses of abra@@ x@@ ane in people with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma centr@@ ation decreased in a multi @-@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ tri@@ angular distribution and / or female engagement of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
the treatment of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dose ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of abrasion in people with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from bright light over 8 hours .

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which complications could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients suffering from kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ sen@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have given appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter , respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients suffering from kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ emia or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which em@@ powers it to the formation of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ sen@@ amed was compared as injection into a vein as part of a study involving 4@@ 79 patients , who suffered an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ sen@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period during the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Bot@@ t@@ amed under the skin were analyzed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were maintained in the same degree as those patients continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ sen@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ sen@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ sen@@ amed , according to the European Union regulations , evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ sen@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission approved the company Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the distribution of Ab@@ sen@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirement in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion arises due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures , which demand a large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
Ab@@ sen@@ amed can be used to reduce foreign blood from a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
&quot; H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be used , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , in which ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability of patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dosage required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dosage required for control of the symptoms symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has risen to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has risen by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ fs is required , should receive Ab@@ sen@@ amed twice a week in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week before the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the Ab@@ sen@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg at 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug into the circulation system . &quot;
patients who suffer from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ sen@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ enia ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esia @-@ known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ isms ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or vascular disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ tis or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ enia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ inflammatory PR@@ CA according to monthly until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ un toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , loss of blood and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking account of an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ yte index ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ sen@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentrations should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 .
clinical trials have observed increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) have been given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefits attributed to ep@@ ox@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of an@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentrations should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in case of tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who have to be trans@@ co@@ ded ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the patient &apos;s participation which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting weight value of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ ox@@ ins were not detected that they can improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia , or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no indication of an interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF with regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly events ( see Section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; the gene@@ tically derived ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate proportion , identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine in the patient . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ ov@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with ha@@ em@@ o@@ blast@@ osis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ h lymph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ em@@ o@@ blast@@ omas ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 M@@ amm@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;

survival and tumour progression have been studied in five major controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the patient . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin consistently showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in checks .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value under 13 g / dl since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs after re@@ peti@@ tive intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um mirrors that are reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain equal , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ a@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 in animal experimental studies involving nearly the 20 @-@ fold of the recommended weekly dose of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced f@@ ec@@ al body weight , a del@@ aying of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in the fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro @-@ findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the license agreement comm@@ its to the studies and additional measures listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as in accordance with each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan , adopted by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for In@@ use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • If new information has an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures , within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) &quot;
&quot; • In a month before your treatment has suffered a heart attack or stroke , if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time appearing or increased chest pain ) - if you have already performed such a blood c@@ lot earlier than before , &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clusi@@ on disease ) , the vascular ( vascular disease of the carcin@@ omas ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ) , you recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed , within the normal range , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ stores with further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or consequ@@ ent acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before beginning of therapy with Ab@@ sen@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ inflammatory ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ enia by months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin @-@ spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ enia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ sen@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ sen@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror exceeds a certain amount . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of the blood arm with Ab@@ sen@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ sen@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood pig@@ ment ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood c@@ logging ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past already thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ sen@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances the tumor may adver@@ sely affect the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , you should check the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood pig@@ ment ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ sen@@ amed because there is increased risk of blood c@@ logging after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines , or have recently taken / used medicine , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ sen@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means for the development of the immune system , for example in cancer @-@ chemotherapy or with HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia is addressed to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you receive regular doses of Ab@@ sen@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia is addressing the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor believes this is appropriate , you can also learn how to use Ab@@ sen@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;

&quot; if a sy@@ ringe has been taken from the refrigerator and the room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or disc@@ ar@@ ded . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ eric is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like the H@@ inf@@ ant ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that alters the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; before first inf@@ usion , patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ eric can reduce the symptoms arising in the three days after inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , A@@ cl@@ eric can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ eric is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
&quot; the first study included nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined for a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined for a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ eric was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ eric ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients in A@@ cl@@ eric ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ eric had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ eric side effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent with repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ eric must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in A@@ cl@@ era are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ eric provides recon@@ n@@ aissance material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ eric for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
April 2005 European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve A@@ cl@@ eric &apos;s per@@ missions throughout the European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture .
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and for breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate bodily activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ eric is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ eric should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ eric a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who have responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ eric ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ eric inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ eric can be reduced by offering Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of A@@ cl@@ eric .
patients with kidney impair@@ ment ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ eric is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age since data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ eric is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ a@@ emia is to be treated before the onset of therapy with A@@ cl@@ eric in sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ a@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ eric ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ eric ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be weigh@@ ed before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental hand@@ gri@@ ps , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days following A@@ cl@@ eric can be reduced by offering Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of A@@ cl@@ eric ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who received A@@ cl@@ ue increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ eric ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney impair@@ ment Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney impair@@ ments , which expressed itself as decrease of kidney function ( i.e. , an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases diagnosed as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the implant clearing ( measured yearly before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ eric compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were treated in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ eric in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ eric in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a recently discovered hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ eric ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion location , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area was occasionally reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections , including oste@@ o@@ cul@@ es , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients presented oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the max@@ illary area in one patient with A@@ cl@@ eric and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be obtained by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ eric 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing vort@@ ex body .
effects on morph@@ ometric properties of the spinal fluid A@@ cl@@ eric lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the incidence of one or more new flu@@ idi@@ zed @-@ body re@@ frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ eric @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal fluid compared with plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on the frac@@ ture frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ eric showed a constant effect over three years that resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI ) .
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ eric increased bone density on lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase in bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6,0 % , of the fem@@ al neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ eric ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were removed one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the basin .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cl@@ eric in comparison with plac@@ ebo to increase the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) - the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ eric declined significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks prior to inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ eric , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
effects on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the A@@ cl@@ eric treatment compared with plac@@ ebo treatment increased the BM@@ D at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ eric treatment performed over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % of the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in males In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study were random@@ ised 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ eric @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ eric in comparison with the once weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at referred to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
clinical effectiveness of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ eric was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years using radi@@ ologically confirmed glaucoma ( mean ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison with the intake of 30 mg crack @-@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was detected in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ eric and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six month study ( respon@@ sive to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ cl@@ eric &apos;s 143 with A@@ cl@@ eric and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study could maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ eric , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma gas quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum . &quot;
rapid bi@@ polar disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life hours t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination period with a terminal elimination time t ½ γ 146 hours .
&quot; the early distribution stages ( α and β , with the above t ½ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is in the urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
&quot; total Body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the inf@@ usion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma centr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ances caused by cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and in 64 patients studied in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid .
&quot; because for severe kidney impair@@ ment ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest not let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous single dose was at mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C mean 6@@ times of recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats , administered in intervals of 2 @-@ day intervals , administered approximately 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 6 @-@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the 7@@ th@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats showed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced ser@@ um @-@ calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after the preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the Phar@@ mak@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
the holder of approval for placing on the market comm@@ its the studies and additional activities to the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance performed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 004 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on the safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance of a substance , called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ condition@@ ally , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ eric works by norm@@ alising bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ eric with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines / use / use other medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known that they are damaging the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ eric together with food and drinks , you are concerned that you will take sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an inf@@ usion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make A@@ cl@@ ue &apos;s administration two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an inf@@ usion in a vein .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ue works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood are not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; for Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ eric can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ eric is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
before completing the treatment with A@@ cl@@ eric If you are considering completion of treatment with A@@ cl@@ eric please take your nearest doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
&quot; side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after the inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
&quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ eric causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or on the jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently experienced low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to undertake the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ eric two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ a@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the treatment supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , A@@ comp@@ lia is associated with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over or over . &quot;
four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used in comparison to a plac@@ ebo as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking .
&quot; on the other hand , the studies aimed at setting the smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it &apos;s the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tissue . n@@ g The complete list of side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia is to remove the package . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , provoke a small minority of patients suicide . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised at con@@ current use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , Tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ comp@@ lia &apos;s effectiveness in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight
treatments used in patients who need it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and doctors ) and around the Ar@@ z
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I &gt; 30 kg / m ² ) or over@@ weight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also contain one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ enia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used and in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides obesity - are no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons may point out that it is necessary to monitor the re @-@ occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice when these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not adequately shown .
&quot; patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from trials with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Johannis@@ kr@@ aut ) has not been studied , is assumed that the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of potent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma centri@@ city of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
patients with obes@@ e patients and patients with obesity have been examined and more than 38@@ 00 patients in other indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects that occurred under treatment in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and accompanying metabolism diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for undes@@ irable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In the evaluation of side effects , the following frequency are fundamental : &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only mild symptoms were observed in a toler@@ ant study in which a limited number of persons were given dispos@@ als of up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and at the same time existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6,5 kg relative to the bas@@ eline value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 ; -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4,@@ 2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
9 Weight reduction and other risk factors In clinical trials in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des of 6.@@ 9 % was observed ( initial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 % &quot;
in a second study in patients with obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in plac@@ ebo
the percentage of patients who reached H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the difference in mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 and -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z
&quot; 2 hours achieved , the Ste@@ ady @-@ State plasma bars were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; influence of food : it subjects , which Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant received either in the in@@ famous state or after a fat @-@ fat meal , showed a 67 % higher C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C in the case of food intake . &quot;
patients with black skin colour can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ eutical analyses ( ages 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Prec@@ ise clinical data for safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical studies , but were considered to be relevant for clinical use as potentially relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases the onset of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals seems to be connected . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycl@@ amen . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by means of lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abolic medication ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be set to satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ f@@ onic resin and insulin can be retained with the onset of acet@@ one treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ onic resin and insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be utilized better , and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ onic resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or Plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels have been lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ um in a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional plac@@ ebo was reduced to 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had been studied in 289 patients , the patients , the Ac@@ tos plus insulin , showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ations ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirrors - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is not suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study conducted with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing metastatic disease neu@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , there was an increase in reports about heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated levels of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are elevated to the 3 @-@ fold upper limit of the normal range , the liver Enzy@@ mes must be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , wa@@ iter shade , red@@ ness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver Enzy@@ mes must be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the lab parameters are passed by the clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical trials involving pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can touch fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral dual @-@ secondary or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a two @-@ professional combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , it was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ ol@@ amide , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , about a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , with a decrease of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is direct connection between the ing@@ es@@ tion of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ p@@ tive doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report about disturb@@ ances of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ tures were 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient &apos;s years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ co .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures reported in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is reset ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal dimin@@ ishes and thereby dimin@@ ishes the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from available data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the lens of the lens , as observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T pains soon occurred on the triple point of the upper limit of the normal range , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ as@@ cular disease the incidence of severe con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
&quot; since the market launch , it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medi@@ ated groups . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occ@@ ured . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptor ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ ine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is determined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient , despite three months of optim@@ ising with insulin , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.45 % , compared with patients receiving insulin , reducing insulin doses in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
in clinical studies over a year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small , 18 weeks study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing metastatic disease neu@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorb@@ able , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equal to the three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma centri@@ city of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after the oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , mark@@ ers were found mainly in the f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the entire active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies were consistent with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and thus reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) elevated incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ an indi@@ ces resulted in increased incidence of col@@ oni@@ um@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ tures were 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient &apos;s years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ co .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures reported in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ent showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both through an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study failed in terms of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , ap@@ amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced similarly to other human insulin levels . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may be adapted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes are out@@ weighing the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood glucose adjustment has improved significantly , for example by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi @-@ insulin , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; prior to travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek advice from his doctor as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the physician must take into account potential interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients after other medicines they have taken . &quot;

diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ asi@@ onally - Peri@@ pher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however be developed incre@@ mentally : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated through oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape fruit , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the duration of the active period is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a series of cle@@ av@@ age ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) loc@@ alities on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the cle@@ av@@ age is active .

acet@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transfer of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are bl@@ ended , the amount of insulin that is rapidly acting must first be raised , then the amount of insulin that has been acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adaptation is necessary in case of change to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; prior to travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek advice from his doctor as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and complaints at the administration of administration occasionally occur - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions during insulin therapy may occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied to patients who are already showing signs of crystall@@ is@@ ations , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater pri@@ med crystals that can lead to joints and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the level of ur@@ ic acid is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur , which is why it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic or other medicines to contrac@@ eption . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared one year to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic intake 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily intake 120 mg , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver enzymes . &quot;
especially in patients with cardiac complaints in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective when lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood as allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ inary abl@@ ation ( including one from the medical history known or currently available g@@ out no@@ des and / or g@@ out arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose elevation can be taken into consideration at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ances &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since organ transplan@@ t recipients have no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or degenerative heart failure ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ saw drugs , it can result in acute g@@ asi@@ fication during the course of treatment , because the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ut saw first to mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue . &quot;

&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed in patients reported in February ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore advised to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the February treatment and in the further course according to clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .

in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of undes@@ irable events .
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily mean a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the recording of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies cannot be concluded on the side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not include direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or while exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably confident that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported was observed in the overall f@@ og@@ ging group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and reported in all Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ chic@@ ine at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all Feb@@ r@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to the information occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ v@@ ot studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ ot@@ th@@ esia , show@@ y EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , erectile dysfunction , increase in potassium concentration in the blood , decrease in the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and arises as part of the reaction chain Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly Ser@@ um har@@ n@@ saw levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment value at the start of study of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1,5 and ≤ 0,5 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were sum@@ mar@@ ised for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ saw level on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the doctor &apos;s visit week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney impair@@ ment ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney impair@@ ments ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the open extension study conducted in Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in ser@@ um har@@ n@@ saw levels on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out cases , so that less than 3 % of patients required no treatment against a delay in the months of 16 @-@ 24 . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the no@@ des until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma centri@@ city @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at after administration increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ propor@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose rate increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um acid concentration if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma protein binding of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly produced by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ stat@@ u@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair appeared as unchanged Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at took around the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney disease function .
&quot; 12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes with regard to AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately 11 @-@ fold exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a special Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and are considered non @-@ relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in the case of high doses , which were about the 4.3 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occ@@ ured , which accompanied by a reduction in the rise performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which are about 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , who are buried approximately the 13 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , did not have ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
diar@@ rho@@ ea and nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ chic@@ ine at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; 21 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly Ser@@ um har@@ n@@ saw levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .

&quot; the owner of the licence for placing on the market has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , is ready before the medicine is transferred to traffic , and as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline , an updated R@@ MP is to present risk management systems for human medicines with the next peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ IS ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is necessary • If new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk management • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and in this way reached a decrease of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the active Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine , or if you have a cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency or suffer from any other cardiac problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a row of cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ h@@ han @-@ Syn@@ dro@@ ms ( a rare con@@ genital disorder in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out is cleared before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be in any case , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; if required , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a g@@ out attack or treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines , or have recently taken / used medicine , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are frac@@ tion@@ ated ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the pill . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data coming from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D sp@@ ies .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data which show that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose , which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal muscle ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive disorders such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( membran@@ es ) , tum@@ ul@@ cer ( membran@@ es ) , ri@@ pen@@ ed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as sau@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergy ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 710 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can only be given with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hospit@@ alization ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point out to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who don &apos;t take the medicine properly and / or take it after the appearance of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , gast@@ ric and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy is predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the cancellation of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a deeper surgical procedure , reduces the risk of a bone frac@@ ture of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they are supposed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ a@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before beginning treatment .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or nursing women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not give notice of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports originate from cancer patients , but also in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , lowering of the ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ um up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um @-@ phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ struction of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tur@@ ine incidence in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in Phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the ver@@ teb@@ ral column , 5.@@ 9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.8 % of the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of ver@@ teb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the dose of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies of rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily divided into female tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;

&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearance rate did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted through the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is likely that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bones is to be expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in whom the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining , for example , a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been carried out and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be used in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f because the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ t rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; orders of wor@@ ding or regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us table mirror should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a mirror , was comparable to both ni@@ er@@ - and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level are recommended during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate re @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first postoperative period , the intraven@@ ous tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application To suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be later required as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initial dosage recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In case of adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there are no clinical experience with advoc@@ ate , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0,2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood vessels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um carcin@@ omas , a calculation of the cre@@ atine content and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In case of switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases by taking supplements of whole blood @-@ blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ king @-@ Level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood Tal@@ ents from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adjustment , Chang@@ es of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the table levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in full blood during the first time after liver transplan@@ tations in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t rejection or other side effects , which may occur due to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over @-@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; orders of wor@@ ding or regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is no clinical data for advoc@@ ated advoc@@ acy Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients , there is still no clinical data for advoc@@ ated advoc@@ acy Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases it was possible to observe a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which can therefore also be found under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ rup@@ tions are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , liquid pollution and o@@ ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual disturb@@ ances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose contain , special caution is required in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while adding substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , and with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal im@@ itation .
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s metabolism on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious when decisions are made . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not suggest that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in the case of uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended to possible harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ co@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the toxic@@ ity profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be detected because of the disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; as is known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , patients who are treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are suscep@@ tible to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ a ) . &quot;
cases of F@@ BK @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated Progressive multi@@ focal Leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with advoc@@ acy .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
effect mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level should be medi@@ ated by the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ hi@@ lic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in cell inn@@ s .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent blocking of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .

12 confirmed acute rep@@ ul@@ ations amounted to 32.@@ 6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 237 ) 32.@@ 6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 234 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

&quot; 175 patients were transplan@@ ted , in 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ as transplan@@ t and used in 630 cases following an intestinal transplan@@ t as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant medication . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted , multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was less common in the first year following the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % vs. 8,@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us there were 21.@@ 7 % of cases of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % among C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ts patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group greater ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
a multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients who simultaneously received a Pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized procedure tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dosage ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after col@@ on transplan@@ tation showed 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines , and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on a current survival rate of 75 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods of early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional gift of the Inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ liz@@ umab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to seb@@ ac@@ ial radiation between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the und@@ et@@ ected fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of the metabolism with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was nearly 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding into joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which em@@ powers them to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is a different medicine approved in the European Union named Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is different , so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , Adv@@ ate &apos;s efficacy in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ ors was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission informed the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG a licence for placing advoc@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency following the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the given plasma tor@@ ques ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is pre@@ valent for the patient .
&quot; during the course of treatment , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections should be recommended to determine the factor VIII plasma . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
the dosage speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure times and an@@ am@@ n@@ esi@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , the re@@ occurrence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there is no experience of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which had a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post @-@ operative ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was observed ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE were treated with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins has been analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise no signs or symptoms indic@@ ted on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ dat@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product tex@@ tures within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ act@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) . &quot;
the activated factor VIII acts as a factor factor for activ@@ ating factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of the factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since initial approval , CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the admission regi@@ stran@@ t should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited distributed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company with@@ drew its application for approval for the handling of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer .
&quot; usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus which has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in &apos;s virus is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself , thus causing no infection in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed of the p@@ 53 gene that is not present in the human body , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work correctly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the area of the sub@@ tree , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions raised , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submission documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the review will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are set in such a way that one of the effective components is immediately released , and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be termin@@ ated once symptoms , especially swelling of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effectiveness measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all h@@ ay fever symptoms , in addition to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who participated in aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart disease or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( caused by cereb@@ ro@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , to cr@@ ush or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of absence of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within the 2 weeks of ending such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity combined with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctions like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ le@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ ic , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be attributed to per@@ oral or nas@@ al as abnormal r@@ hin@@ ology ( eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ oline etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient @-@ collective and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be completed at least 48 hours before performing the tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , there were no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ ation during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not raise the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases there can be a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness that can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , complicated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturb@@ ances , and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary ar@@ re and - dil@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including rein@@ forcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess versus plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total score for the symptom ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to dimin@@ ishing effects , determined on the basis of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine via the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it has been found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are poor@@ ly confused . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent to the exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive c@@ ox@@ ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving around 4 800 adults and young people with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies for seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
&quot; effectiveness has been measured by determining the change of the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to verify that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ tion and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us increased from 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks was treated with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for placing A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression and may be termin@@ ated following the symptoms of symptoms and resum@@ ed in their re@@ occurring symptoms .
the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during allergies .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased during the simultaneous intake of alcohol and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be assumptions that may lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common adverse effect was head@@ ache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( ninet@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses found in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in a single dose study with adults Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flu@@ gli@@ ding including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks associated with flying .
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and per@@ enni@@ al allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
&quot; since the history of hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ar@@ tic diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the disorder of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patient Dem@@ ographi@@ es were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines is not completely eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , and by Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine will not be able to detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an infectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ aboli@@ zing Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience higher substance strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which fully met@@ aboli@@ ze , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , boo@@ sting effect of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose was 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us reported than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( ninet@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily dose of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was no increased incidence of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single @-@ daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not harm the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ induced impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decrease the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable in pedi@@ atric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
&quot; however , this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in Type III Bra@@ king bottles with a child@@ proof poly@@ propylene seal cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to inhal@@ e once a day in the mouth to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( ninet@@ een clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg a day for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess versus plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including rein@@ forcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patient Dem@@ ographi@@ es were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( adults , 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dose in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

an A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg tablet tablet once daily put into the mouth to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg tablets proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formula and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for the initi@@ ation formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg a day for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including rein@@ forcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in single @-@ dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg tablet tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the enam@@ el tablet revealed that this wor@@ ding represents an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children from 2 to 11 years , which fully met@@ aboli@@ ze , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
in an additional study a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution to inhal@@ e no side @-@ effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was no increased incidence of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis in reli@@ ance on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no bio @-@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses with those of adults who received the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company takes its application for approval for the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influ@@ enza caused by the stem ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine intended to protect against a stem of the flu virus causing a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus emerges , which can easily spread from man to man because humans have not yet built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine passed , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus of this stem of rapid antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane she@@ ath of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a body alien ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic is available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
it should be as@@ cer@@ tained only when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medication the patient has previously taken and the likel@@ ihood is that the virus is addressed to the drug .
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of ritual and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ thma depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , as@@ gener@@ a decreases the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not to cure , but it can delay the immune system &apos;s damage and thus the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug consumed with low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with 206 adults who used earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in the case of children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but the children , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , responded very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the anti @-@ virus vir@@ us@@ burden increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks compared with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; am@@ a@@ ec@@ tomy may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines , which are degra@@ ded in the same way as am@@ a@@ are and are harmful in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is the risk of a lip@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ Activ@@ ation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of am@@ a@@ are in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefit of am@@ using in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; am@@ a@@ ec@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of as@@ gener@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , A@@ generic is indicated for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
usually aspir@@ in capsules should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r together with low doses of p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic Cap@@ sules should be used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses should be used ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ a@@ are combined with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; am@@ a@@ ec@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generic capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver function impair@@ ment to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ in may not simultaneously be given with medicines that have low therapeutic widths , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of pren@@ am@@ pren@@ am@@ r during the intake of pren@@ am@@ pren@@ am@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ a@@ are or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually aspir@@ in capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially fatal progression .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with an existing limited liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased incidence of hep@@ atic dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a and p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including the disease of Cus@@ hing and supp@@ ressing the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended to make am@@ a@@ ze with Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the elevated risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these medicines at the same time , am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r can be less effective due to decreased plasma bars ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on or@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ative symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ hol content of the A@@ generic solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; am@@ a@@ ec@@ ase should be set in duration 5 , if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses related to their therapy medications that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. increased age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width a@@ gen@@ ase may not simultaneously be given with medicines that have low therapeutic widths , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose elevation of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirrors of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already uses St John &apos;s wort , the spr@@ inkl@@ ing mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; on the other hand , it is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r were repeated twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ am@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min @-@ Val@@ ues of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritual .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in conjunction with Di@@ th@@ os@@ in , but due to the anta@@ ci@@ dal component of Di@@ th@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the income of Di@@ th@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
treatment with avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be reduced .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and associated side @-@ effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with am@@ o@@ cr@@ ine in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plasma bars of both drugs may be increased in case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed once daily without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially lead to interactions with as@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as am@@ a@@ ec@@ ase , as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption disturb@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r can lead to degradation of the plasma tor@@ so of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ dic@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of as@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ el@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of plasma bars while am@@ ending am@@ a@@ are . &quot;
&quot; since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to use par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma tor@@ ques from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on or@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ative symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , such as the pren@@ avi@@ rin dose , if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation R@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predicted , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother , compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats were detected am@@ pren@@ am@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during the seed was given to pregnant rats administered by the uter@@ us in uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most associated side effects were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are in connection with the intake of am@@ a@@ are or any other medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) assessed by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and isolated sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ treated individuals treated with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stal@@ ks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , patients treated in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s showed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared spontan@@ eously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontan@@ eously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI previously untreated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily together with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is aware of signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures should be introduced . &quot;
&quot; pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral ag@@ g@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein stages with the consequence of formation of in@@ tru@@ der , non infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral and previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; in the case of sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral , not previously untreated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Nas@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations may be used to estimate the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of Mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , combined with an increased probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for ass@@ essing the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ off@@ s ( dividing points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ am@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r however remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral and not previously untreated patients , in which a fossil @-@ pren@@ am@@ r @-@ like scheme failed ( one of these showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 ins@@ ulated ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ators ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ators ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ators ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; early abor@@ tion of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of am@@ a@@ ec@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI pre @-@ treated adults according to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side catalog ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to am@@ generation , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI Group with regard to time @-@ adj@@ us@@ ated A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks in case of non @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of untreated a@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic Solutions for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
the majority of patients treated with PI had previously at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ generic .
&quot; after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI previously untreated children . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 508 % is reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent de@@ part@@ mental volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ attached am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ attached am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that can indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the dose of am@@ using capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily transplan@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and A@@ generic capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a multi @-@ gram@@ metric basis .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of kidney impair@@ ment may be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment regim@@ ens result in am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r on mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in mascul@@ ine animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , correspon@@ ded . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , from the actual exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there was little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse tran@@ scripts ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither nuts nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of am@@ a@@ are nor after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies of toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at the age of 4 , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure below therapeutic dosage in humans , however , there were a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 When am@@ a@@ or@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses should be used ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of AM@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with weak or light liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; am@@ a@@ ec@@ ase should be depos@@ ited on Dur@@ ation 27 , if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of lip@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addi@@ cts , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min @-@ Val@@ ues of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritual .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
treatment with avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be reduced .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to dose Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ generic , at least half of the recommended dose should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ dic@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine

an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation R@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ am@@ r by 22 % .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble study of pregnant rats administered by the in@@ ni@@ dation to the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is aware of signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures should be introduced . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI previously untreated children . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ attached am@@ pren@@ am@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that can indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney impair@@ ment may be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r on mice and rats occ@@ ured hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas during doses which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , from the actual exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there was little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse tran@@ scripts ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither nuts nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies of toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at the age of 4 , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ am@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that the metabolism is not fully developed in young , so that am@@ pren@@ am@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic solution for dispos@@ ing is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
the use of p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; A@@ generic solution for inser@@ tion was not covered with PI previously untreated patients or PI previously untreated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution for taking ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ am@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ a solution for inser@@ tion and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ am@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ generic solution for det@@ ecting patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ col@@ ds , A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated for inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients suffering from kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side @-@ effects like heart rhythm disturb@@ ances ( z .
patients should be advised that am@@ a@@ are or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk 47 of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side @-@ effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
am@@ a@@ ec@@ ase should be removed for duration when a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of lip@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ containing 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to associated side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ generic solution for inser@@ tion may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats were detected am@@ pren@@ am@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a reduced increase of 55 body weight was observed in the descendants . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are in connection with the intake of am@@ a@@ are or any other medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral and previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; early abor@@ tion of a stag@@ gering 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI previously untreated children . &quot;
the apparent de@@ part@@ mental volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large c@@ ve@@ al volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ am@@ r from the blood@@ stream to the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure below therapeutic dosage in humans , however , there were a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease being treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times weekly for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week during one or two four @-@ week cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is applied thin@@ ly to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo applied either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ mos@@ s .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the treated with Al@@ dar@@ a . • The results of the two studies were treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;

&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ bly infected skin area , until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
there should be a balance between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily routine was performed , two cases of heavy p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with a leading stri@@ k@@ cont@@ our were observed . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which have necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applic@@ ated means for the treatment of external fung@@ al war@@ ts in the genital and peripher@@ y area , no clinical experiences have yet been found . &quot;
&quot; although limited data indicates an increased rate of prevention reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group in regard to eradi@@ c@@ ating f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair approach was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions is generally decreased during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is required due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since no data is available for long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in the case of super@@ cili@@ ary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs , there is no clinical experience , therefore the use of previously untreated tum@@ ours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial indicates that tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of ac@@ tin cans on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears , or on the lips area inside the lips . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic Ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the efficacy in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions are usually decl@@ ining in the course of therapy or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial reveals that patients with more than 8 acts showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although no quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been quanti@@ fied , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly shared and probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ es treated from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related adverse effects were in these studies a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
adverse events affecting 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme are listed below .
&quot; according to the study plan , the evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / foli@@ age ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the study plan , the evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often resulted in severe Er@@ y@@ Top@@ ics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sc@@ oring and enc@@ ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ mos@@ a Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 patient @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies showed that efficacy with regard to a complete healing of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of the 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide , the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces healed completely ; this was in 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI : &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ cili@@ ary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic files within a co@@ hesive 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ cili@@ ary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with acute Ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and buried 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour period following the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ sick skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ cili@@ atory bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with a minor administration on three days a week induced not tum@@ ors at the application site .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not suspected , there is a risk to man due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the more effective cream in earlier times and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
&quot; it may harm other people , even if these have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; ● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the field of gen@@ it@@ alia ( sexual organs ) and anus ( After ) ● surface bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a commonly occurring , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if left untreated , it can lead to con@@ stell@@ ations , especially in the face - therefore an early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ mos@@ s are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who have been exposed much of the solar radiation during their life . &quot;
al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in shallow ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances , which help your body combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection . &quot;
&quot; O If you have applied al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about before you start treatment . o Find your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . &quot;
&quot; in case of acci@@ dental contact the cream is not absorbed by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o Do not rub the cream in@@ war@@ dly . o Use the treated spot after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not with a band@@ age or plaster . o If reactions to the treated place occur , which will cause you strong dis@@ comfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are dis@@ continued , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of skin or difficulty can be expected if the fores@@ kin is with@@ drawn . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have sexual intercourse with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) perform . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have applied other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; breast@@ feeding your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , since it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over@@ comes into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin point with the ti@@ lt and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
men with til@@ ting under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath it ( see section 2 &quot; What do you have to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , 5 days a week , a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream can be applied to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects ( expected for more than 1 out of 10 patients ) frequent side effects ( in less than 1 out of 10 patients expect ) rare side effects ( in less than 1 out of 100 patients expect ) Very rare side effects ( with less than 1 out of 10,000 patients expected ) &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infection ; it can cause you to get a blue stain sooner or you can cause distress .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this user information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of the patients ) , burning ( 26 % of the patients ) or pain in the areas on which you applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
usually these are lighter skin reactions that disappear within about 2 weeks after the treatment is removed .
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the place of application ( wound secre@@ tions , inflammation , swelling , irrit@@ ation , skin destruction , bladder , der@@ m@@ atitis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the place of application ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , ul@@ cer@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , or dis@@ comfort ) , inflammation of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , swelling of the eyel@@ ids , throat pain , fever , weakness or shi@@ vering . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a proven diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ onic deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements more difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ charging equipment , and patients may require appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was mainly studied , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect on reducing the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of more than five ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion site . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart@@ beat ) , fever and shi@@ vers . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; each year the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is given to patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding reactions to inf@@ usion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to appro@@ ve the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ onic oxid@@ ase and is produced using a re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster O@@ vary ) .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a proven diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ onic deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule is recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or hep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined and no dosing schedule is recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical setting , in which medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience concerning the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after a break of the treatment must be cau@@ tious . &quot;
60 minutes before the onset of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
&quot; experimental studies do not lead to direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on breast milk , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me not to breast@@ feed . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily associated with inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase III study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are performed in the following table following the following frequency ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respiratory tract and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
in most patients there was a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the onset of the treatment . in the age of 5 with a heavier run@@ out form the ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within a month ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature withdrawal from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay antibodies , including 3 patients , in whom it was never used to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with lacking until low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase III study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alising inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions was typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in a sub@@ strate for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study the majority of patients were seen from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for more than 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ga@@ it , presented in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute mon@@ ary volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in general an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe dro@@ p@@ out form and 4 with the mean circul@@ ating form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks because of increased Gag@@ - Mir@@ rors in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in case of a number of patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) detected a normal mental develop@@ mental speed according to the Z @-@ Score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental develop@@ mental speed , whereas in older patients with severe dis@@ continued form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosage schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage regim@@ en with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ si@@ ers is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate every new information available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of blood vessels to be dil@@ uted according to body weight .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who still have no chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; to decrease side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) and vitamin B@@ 12 inj@@ ections during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic drug &quot; &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or reduced the dose . &quot;
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and longer life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin over@@ lived 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies patients , in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells , showed longer survival rates than with the comparison medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission informed the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to appro@@ ve the transportation of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the required wick volume is taken from the cookie and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
&quot; in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as an inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cancer , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction in frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for further 21 days following the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dosage and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a full blood image should be created before every gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , dose @-@ check must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r &apos;s blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 blood .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient prescri@@ bes the value before the treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical trials have no indication that in the age of 65 years or over , patients aged 65 years old have an increased side effect . &quot;
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dose adjustment necessary to go beyond the dose calculations recommended for all patients .
the data storage in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a hep@@ atic dys@@ functional restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper cili@@ ary limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in det@@ achment of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to the bone level suppression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality count once again reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in the preceding cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be instruc@@ ted with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tically lac@@ tical measure to reduce the related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous taking of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ phosph@@ or@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days prior to treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in whom these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the out@@ flow prior to the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , occasionally , if this drug was commonly used in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible impair@@ ment of the reproductive capacity via tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men ought to be advised in front of the treatment regim@@ en to seek advice regarding the spar@@ ring conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ phosph@@ or@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can result in a reduced breakdown of side effects . &quot;
caution is advisable when applied in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ y@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid is avoided at high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ in@@ op@@ last@@ y chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat patient patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as for an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy , except when absolutely demanding and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity via tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to consult advice regarding the closure of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether tel@@ emet@@ re@@ est@@ ration passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .

&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the combined study phase 3 , except neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of the liver function tests .

&quot; patients with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
patients with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneumatic pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before or after their P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed regim@@ en ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA ( p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ in@@ op@@ last@@ y anti@@ fol@@ ate , which exercises its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting weight @-@ sensitive metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ sp@@ la@@ ity ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ c@@ ig@@ amide ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study by ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin treated patients with a clin@@ ically significant benefit of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival compared to those patients who were treated with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the treatment arms ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural therapy was demonstrated in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) versus the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a di@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in control .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC treated patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( int@@ ent to treat population n = 283 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival fell in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ cell epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study show efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ maintenance of ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; average P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0,@@ 94 - 1,@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the impact of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = Conc@@ eption interval ; IT@@ T = int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ Unter@@ le@@ gen@@ heits@@ Limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ f@@ usions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients required the dose of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;

&quot; dis@@ solve the content of 500 mg cookie cut@@ ters with a 20 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , which results in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed . &quot;
the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality .
&quot; it is used for obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot de@@ grade some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg for taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco walk , tier ld@@ rank , gre@@ asy secre@@ tion ( decay ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be applied to patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not sufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) , or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission approved G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the distribution of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ us@@ ory low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 , as there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is necessary for older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• Simul@@ tan@@ eous hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tan@@ eous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • P@@ reg@@ ation ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tan@@ eous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase when all@@ i is taken together with a high @-@ fat single meal or fet@@ cher diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ etics is necessary . &quot;
&quot; patients who take All@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted . &quot;
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ related measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed . &quot;
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at for up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after receiving a dispos@@ able dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a marginal decrease in am@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
the incidence of known side effects reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to comb@@ ating infections with regard to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered three times a day over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after market launch , either side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported . &quot;
based on studies on humans and animals can be assumed from a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ ol properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is based on the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ b rem@@ n@@ ants of the ga@@ str@@ ical and pancre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
&quot; clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , three times a day , inhi@@ bit the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ us@@ ory , high @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , has been assessed as follows : a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was obtained with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; during the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral implant@@ ation of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could not be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients with minimal systemic absorb@@ able dose , two main metabolic disorders , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ Form@@ yl Leu@@ c@@ ine Group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plastic surgery . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; food di@@ aries are effective , as you can always track what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits . &quot;
&quot; to safely achieve your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Get low @-@ fat to reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompan@@ im@@ ents ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity .
• If you cannot detect any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of use by all@@ i please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
&quot; under certain circumstances , you have to stop taking all@@ i . • With a successful weight loss , it is not about to change the diet and return to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , pick up the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take capsule . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this user information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of operation of the capsules and will result in increased fat from the body .
&quot; these side effects generally occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you might have not consistently reduced fat content in the diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompan@@ im@@ ents : • Start some days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and the size of the portions that you normally take . &quot;
if you know exactly how much you eat decreases the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a high @-@ fat main dish or a happy night table as you possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these symptoms appear , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet . &quot;
• Ke@@ ep drugs for children in@@ accessible . • Ke@@ ep not allowed to use anywhere after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep no more than 25 ° C . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel which will serve to keep the capsules dry .
swal@@ low this in any case . • You can use your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) which is included in this package .

obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancer • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis treat your doctor about your risk for these ail@@ ments .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
please note the tables below in this section . • The recommended grease supply in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; which amount is suitable for you , please refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • Based on the effectiveness of the capsule , compliance with recommended grease supply is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended grease supply , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompan@@ im@@ ents . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0,5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low Physi@@ cal Activity &quot; means that you daily do little or not go , steps up in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you pass 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sinn@@ ai is a food diary indicating cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you to develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ ha is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ ha can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since there is not enough information on the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies Alo@@ ha was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ ha showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 out of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ ha showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ ha ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ ha is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , in case of severely inhi@@ bited chemotherapy because of cancer and for preventing nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genous chemotherapy because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ ha for preventing nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised at the same time offering Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or the Q@@ t interval extended , or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chemotherapy medication , Alo@@ ha is supposed to be used neither for prevention nor for treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was not inhibit@@ ing the activity of the five studied chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , one CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as from CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ ha in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reviews . &quot;
the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequency of adverse events as in other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ mode relationships observed .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ eci@@ - over@@ dosing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.3 hours ) received that given to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ powered chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine , 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were given intraven@@ ously to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron . &quot;
the results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron were comparable . &quot;
after clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of det@@ ectable Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In accordance with intraven@@ ous administration , a gradual elimination of the plasma concentr@@ ates follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma centri@@ city ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the overall dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma centri@@ sts was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved a total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the given intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg was comparable ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after dispos@@ ing of 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated through the kid@@ neys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies to metabol@@ ise CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection for healthy patients , total physical exercise was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function impair@@ ment have increased the terminal elimination and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , reducing the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies pointed out that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30@@ times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages used and as Alo@@ ha is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is neg@@ atively assessed for humans . &quot;
the holder of this approval for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision .

June 2006 the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the prescription of the approval of the drug used for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference doctor &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage occurs , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturer presented data that determine the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon with the efficacy of the reference doctor was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study evaluated how many patients after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ard@@ ant in more patients than in the reference drug price ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ z@@ iness , scrat@@ ches and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the physician should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was dis@@ continued after the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wound Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together by skin wound , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough to treat ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ z@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. to appro@@ ve the distribution of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined once and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve , the treatment should be ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started . &quot;
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as path@@ ogen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached in humans after top@@ ical use on s@@ me@@ ared skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After a simultaneous oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % after top@@ ical application of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dosage adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve should only be used during pregnancy if top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / ends or continuing the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be suspended between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the date of administered , which concerned about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; effect retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ tide @-@ transfer centre .
&quot; binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding agents and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms should be obj@@ ection@@ able , couns@@ elling should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of non @-@ compliance with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve was performed daily on oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and sk@@ inn@@ ed skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve twice a day for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary , traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were won . &quot;
the sampling occurred in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual systemic inclusion on humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid disorders . &quot;
in @-@ vitro inspection on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats symptoms of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ew@@ ed skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development ox@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; the Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is passed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensuring that the vacc@@ ination plan exists in two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , the Ambi@@ rix or other Hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines interact by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 , and the vaccine approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are given to children within the framework of an existing vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix took a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain on the injection site , red@@ ness , mat@@ or ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; the Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission informed G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit to transport Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire world &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic mechan@@ isation with the Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
vacc@@ ination for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies lie in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to Hepatitis A vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic response should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination sim@@ pf@@ ile , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody level is achieved under certain circumstances , so that in these cases the application of further vacc@@ ination doses may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these injection paths should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in the case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturb@@ ances , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of age in the form of a separate injection was given simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency , it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this wor@@ ding in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ter@@ ity , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ y- and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and firm@@ ness on a comp@@ ut@@ ational basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % among the subjects after receiving a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination , 6@@ 6.6 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix were suffering from pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of accuracy was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the total vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % among the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and firm@@ ness was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ t@@ ins vaccine scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccine , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when administration with the 3 @-@ cans combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine pattern with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine pattern with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of formal hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ B , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ HB@@ s ser@@ o@@ converter rates were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which have been reached in a clinical comparative study from 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected by at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine scheme . &quot;
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared to the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month vaccine scheme in the 0 @-@ 12 month vaccine scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ des with the isch@@ emia of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current wor@@ ding in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ um conversion rates as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ dium to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; pursuant to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state of charge is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other means , such as swimming in wast@@ ewater , contaminated water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ inations ( although she / her child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels sick ) a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B can not be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed through it@@ chy r@@ ashes , bre@@ aths or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / your child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced amounts of effective constitu@@ ents is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; if you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defence , or if you / your child undergo a ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis ? &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) , or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / has been given or has been given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person therefore is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if any other vaccine has to be given with Ambi@@ rix at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on specific other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed cans ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at the spot or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed doses ) : • swelling of the injection point • F@@ ever ( above 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ aded • g@@ astro@@ intestinal pains
&quot; other side effects , which were reported very rarely after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10.000 vacc@@ inated cans ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include limited or extended excer@@ pts , which can be it@@ chy or can be ves@@ icle @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye part and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice any side effects not specified in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data that has been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only transferred to a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
Ammon@@ ites can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ite enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( cran@@ ial compensation as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ites - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the stomach in the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose to the stomach leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because form@@ ul@@ ae could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do drug , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , irrit@@ ation , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ ash , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ites in patients with mal@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle to high ammon@@ ia levels effectively prevented .
&quot; ammon@@ ites were approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this drug were prescribed . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opathy exists in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake necessary for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from a mani@@ f@@ ﬁ@@ sh deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ pets .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , since there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and kid@@ neys takes place , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate of young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve les@@ ions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occ@@ ured for a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with ur@@ inary tract failure can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analogue in the first year of life .
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born diseases to 80 % in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ ac enc@@ ephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ anor@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by dose of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ c@@ lic or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in arter@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al F@@ asting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was detected .
&quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma bars were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no cl@@ ast@@ al effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either or@@ ally taken ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ born , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from a mani@@ f@@ ﬁ@@ sh deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ pets .
&quot; sy@@ rup gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to obtain the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot separate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you use AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine may go over into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , dis@@ comfort of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( heart attack ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a higher dose , and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on AC@@ S treatment , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a common dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) using the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery in order to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ac@@ o@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ira , other mil@@ k@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in in the treatment of AC@@ S and during one PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the distribution of angi@@ ox@@ es throughout the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in a further row , an additional stud of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken up for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a cle@@ vis of 0.5 mg / kg should be given followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ot@@ ted Bol@@ us @-@ Gabe from An@@ gi@@ ox is not checked and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , a second stud between 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the bolt dosage must be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine versus AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose is checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney damage , which resulted in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the dose of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular h@@ ay .
• severe in@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against her@@ ds@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or elevated blood risk due to a disturb@@ ance of ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; during treatment , patients are carefully monitored with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ valence is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if most of the arter@@ ial points of the arter@@ ial point position occur in PCI @-@ patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ira , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ valence ir@@ is once again reaches the level existing before treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates ) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of blood . &quot;
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ira with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly controlled .
&quot; animal experiments are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ira group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years more often came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or bleeding in the point area , reducing hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; mis@@ cellaneous &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ valence ir@@ u@@ ine in 6000 patients undergoing one PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ira group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years more often came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ categories in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ valence ir@@ is is immediately broken off and the patient will monitor closely with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre as well as at the ani@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ om region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on the other hand slowly re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ valent t@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) induced a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine shows a dose and concentration depend@@ ant an@@ tic@@ ol@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI is performed with the patient , an additional Bol@@ us should be given from 0.@@ 5mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required a angi@@ ography in 72 hours were spread evenly over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went a angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on four@@ fold and triple @-@ end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 . &quot;
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ om@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ira were evaluated in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ira as a pep@@ tide has a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in , the primary metabol@@ ite , resulting from the split of the AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 @-@ binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or administered as continuous inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot work effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from the insulin analog and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter active duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin deficiency or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission informed San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH permission to transport A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and decreased insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement is reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( creator ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the amount of insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or dis@@ continuation of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another insulin type or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
&quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used , and can therefore change when changing the treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
&quot; the substances that can increase blood glucose levels and increase prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ yram@@ ine , fluor@@ o@@ carb@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , tet@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tic agents such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ balance can be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive drugs showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ oid related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not affect breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed from clinical trials of adverse drug effects , group@@ ed by system organ@@ classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; in order to continuously change the injection site within the injection range , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropriately trained person or treated by a physician by intraven@@ ous dose of glucose .
&quot; after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin decreases blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the activity occurs faster and the duration of the action is shorter than in the normal insulin analog .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine showed a dose proportional to proportional to 0,@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate rise in the glu@@ cos@@ ine effect , just like the insulin analog . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has a twice as fast action as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ ine effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was clear that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial level of gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with a human normally insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human regular insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as in the human regular insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
