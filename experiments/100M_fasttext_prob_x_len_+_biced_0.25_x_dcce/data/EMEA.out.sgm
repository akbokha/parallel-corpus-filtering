<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that are dissolved in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. entertain thoughts and speech, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder where patients have manic episodes of abnormal mood alternating with periods of normal tuning."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick check of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to inhale or the enamel tablets in patients that make the swallowing of tablets difficulty."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who at the same time take other medicines that are degraded as well as bilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree as the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"because Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their re-occurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent reoccurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of bilify and placebo to prevent reoccurring, to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness with which Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in patients" symptoms was examined based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment. "</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body resorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg received a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than those who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of several episodes in previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10- or 15mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled impetus), tremor (constant movement), sedation (drowsiness), saliva (drowsiness), saliva hypersecretion (drowsiness), saliva hypersecretion (drowsiness), saliva hypersecretion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in patients, which were predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazl, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and discussed their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the higher sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases by beginning or after change of an anti-psychotic treatment, including in treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"aria prazole should be prescribed cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overwork disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akocelized and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dynasties: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia appearing during treatment with Aripiprazl."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with abilify symptoms and symptoms of late palsy, should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in anamnesis, or in conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazl had an increased risk of dying compared to the placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dose, a significant relationship between dosage and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients dealing with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents, allowing direct comparisons."</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazl, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC from Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common dose of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can-reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be lifted to the dose height prior to escort therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with abilify can be attributed with a moderate rise in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethmorphine / 3-methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethylan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns arising in the animal reproduction studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl does not have any negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="71">"side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic treatment include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late neuroleptic syndrome, late cerebrovascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazl, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosage as Aripiprazl has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazl showed a high affinity to the dopamine D and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptors as well as an even affinity to the dopamine D and 5HT2a, for alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in doses ranging from 0,5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11c racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at the putstream."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study 52 the share of responder patients who maintained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy in reducing systemic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazl showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially applied to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazl showed superior to the prevention of a bipolar disorder, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania."</seg>

<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on the safety spharmacology, toxicity with repeated dose, reproductive dioxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>

<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be terminated once symptoms, especially swelling of nasal mucosa (clogged nose)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effectiveness measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"when only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients under aerinaze showed a decrease of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), somnolence (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influenza caused by the stem (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine intended to protect against a stem of the flu virus causing a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"a flu pandemic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus emerges, which can easily spread from man to man because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after the vaccine passed, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as" "body-alien" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"as a result, the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus of this stem of rapid antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the membrane sheath of the virus with the" "surface antigens" "(proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a body alien), was purified and used as a component of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">"as a result, the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"in the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"in patients receiving a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin in terms of all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin."</seg>
<seg id="2886">"Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalira, other milkudine or any of the other ingredients."</seg>

<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allotted Bolus-Gabe from Angiox is not checked and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"if this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second stud between 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values, the reconstitutive and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the bolt dosage must be administered intravenously."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in patients with moderate kidney impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether treated with bivaliruine versus ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used."</seg>
