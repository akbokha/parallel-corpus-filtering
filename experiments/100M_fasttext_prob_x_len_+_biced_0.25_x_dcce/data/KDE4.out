the module web page can be translated in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras web page . select the output and target language of the translation from the list @-@ down list .
&quot; if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation , and in the worst case non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish website , where you can insert too translated texts directly . &quot;
package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to use .
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings add extensions .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools storage . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
&quot; the module &quot; &quot; Insp@@ ection Filter &quot; &quot; can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; s current working directory in different ways . &quot;
&quot; to view the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the Modul &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size reflects the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , you can easily recognize large files , even then easily , as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched to color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area is used by minor rect@@ angle ( whereby therefore represent@@ ational error may be used by the sign of the staircase ) . moreover , you can set the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; setting algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should generally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ vis@@ er in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is possible to divide the areas so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created , which are as quad@@ r@@ atic as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive sections . &quot;
&quot; you can set the floor space for an entry over the menu entry point view on space . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a script to set the number of thumb@@ nails each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify if the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check @-@ in file size of the image , indicate whether the file size is displayed in the gallery in the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; with the check box image size , indicate whether the size of the images is shown in the gallery in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection store in HTML @-@ file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set with a slider or a knob to which level the sub @-@ folders are included . &quot;
copy the original pictures with the check box if the original pictures are to be copied into the gallery .
use the comment box to indicate a comment file for cap@@ tion the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in original images . &quot;
the Module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; the Media Play@@ back for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the navigation pane window , or using the F@@ 9 key short@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback . &quot;
change browser identification adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add that you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the standard browser identification of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser identification to connect to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser reference is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module review your &amp; CSS ; style templates and &amp; HTML ; documents according to the recommendations of W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Web Site . you can make the following checks :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; check if your &amp; HTML ; -@@ document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; con@@ forms to all found errors . with this test , you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers . &quot;
&quot; allows you to check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets included in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS , your web pages have a uniform appearance independent of the browser used . &quot;
check the links on your page for further instructions and faul@@ ty links . all links are checked on the website recur@@ sively .
here you set the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; styles .
with the module Web Archive for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can save web pages with text and images in .@@ ZIP format .
&quot; click on Tools website with the mouse , and a dialog appears to save the displayed website . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ n ; together . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; includes fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ pack is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion by means of li@@ bra@@ w , DNG , and ICC color management - workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens to search for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvements .
&quot; when you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to invite you to other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; visit the homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for noti@@ fying in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ pack ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path names or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k will be saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ pack ; you will additionally use as an old library . pres@@ ets digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing images as a base folder . no image will be changed . while searching the folder you will get a progress display like this : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ pack ; dur@@ es recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folders . this lets you insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up and set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ word i@@ ste to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported cam@@ cor@@ ders in the Help of Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Assi@@ stance . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ n ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk drive . older cameras may also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that support a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ pack ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am . the Exif support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the preview images . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may possibly see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ pack ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ pack ; , Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; the only limitation is that a picture cannot be displayed in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , RAW , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame works only if this ind of the symbol view is displayed . what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the default settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which are saved by &amp; digi@@ pack ; are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard disk , by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties , or by date on which the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete a collection from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collection settings . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Test@@ ers : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . &quot;
sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Add an album preview &quot; . &quot; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to place it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be scr@@ apped .
the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fiers in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait for a moment while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this in which you can recre@@ ate all preview images in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is , you can change the digi@@ ti@@ sed settings ; select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ pack ; works . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to this . you can view all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ pack ; you can choose between viewing the images or slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edi@@ ting ... or select the contex@@ tual menu of the image using the right mouse button and edit ... in the digi@@ pack section ; Picture Edi@@ ting lets you view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button , and customize the program from the sub@@ menu from the file type . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after editing by other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the picture may occur . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ pack ; delete it , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; shifted . F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or Del if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos by means of data . &amp; digi@@ pack ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the date view so that you can only see the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; tags are stick@@ ers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos shown with this key@@ word will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ pi@@ quot ; to fold , so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are saved in a database for fast access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button , either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or on an existing key@@ word , and then select new key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this will become the for@@ e@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word using the right mouse button and selecting del@@ e@@ tion . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word to move . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and select the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select the Album List . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to place it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a key@@ word , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also use the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and choose the key@@ word from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event it has been made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window as thumb@@ nail . &quot;
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can use the right mouse button to open the photo menu and select removal from the tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit . thus , all associated pictures are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all the pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , hit the head OK and search is performed . the results are used in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit search , the search form will appear to enter the search information previously entered . in case you select an advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ came ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . all rules can be added to the search group / search group . each option can be added to other via the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... nex@@ ct . in addition , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; this allows images to compare by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one . by drag@@ ging a picture from anywhere on the icon of the rough search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hands @-@ free color sket@@ ch : draw a fast sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ p@@ ist ; find the right pictures .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or move out with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . move it while you press the left mouse button . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the bottom field you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; provides a light@@ box in a separate window , which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ table from the contex@@ tual menu .
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy is to be seen in which window pane . if you want to view preview from the tool@@ bar and perform zo@@ oming operations on one of the pictures , then you will also be able to compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly out of a picture series . if you use p@@ airing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same . now , use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the light@@ table like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function , which you can recognize at the crossed arrows . in order to rotate the visible area of the picture , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in mode , both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the zoom control under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and forth . this happens in both images if you are pre@@ viewing in the mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos cap@@ tures , sc@@ ans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos again . we look at the process for digital photographs the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , group , backing , optim@@ ising , waiting and export@@ ing image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management assumes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , sought , transformed , assembled , and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is provided according to your definition data to provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files ensures very fast search and secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and you need to know before you merge anything into your system is the structure of information structure contrary to data structure . you need to decide if other access to your photos should be stored on your computer , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes pile processing easier . separate from old files .
the separation of original and working files makes a backup strategy and migration easier . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option to save metadata in &amp; digi@@ ous ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? added a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now assign keywords , inscri@@ ptions and a rating . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the next work . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; import@@ ing kat@@ alog@@ ized images from another source with embedded key@@ word words , then &amp; digi@@ pack ; automatically build the tree for you res@@ p . the converting of the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed stit@@ ches are followed by &amp; digi@@ pack ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata is in truth out of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ing your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share your photos with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the importance to the viewer to help Him about the motif that you moved has to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ ous , you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as inscription . K@@ DE may even export it for a selection of images . K@@ DE will even export it for a selection of images . &quot;
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet on Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
&quot; I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic indications . &amp; digi@@ pack ; can also export k@@ ml files that can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s name . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which offers the image to others . if the image is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the image is listed here . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ pack ; in the near future , there will be such a module for batch processing . &quot;
&quot; issues : plate error , plate failure , current bre@@ aches , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread ab@@ err@@ ations &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; of course you can buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for you . whether you believe it is in your discretion play room . &quot;
&quot; the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about selecting the right one . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a good program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8,5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; slow down with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . check out the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store in a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : Disk@@ Image study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot detect these errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T &apos;s errors are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot detect these errors . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you may also have data loss due to a power failure before you have backed the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices don &apos;t make much difference , this can cause severe damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage to your computer , which leads to loss of time and money , even before the unavoid@@ able loss . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against black@@ heads is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip . however , remember that not every connector strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripher@@ als that are connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well as by this one over@@ voltage . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power out@@ age occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and order the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with electricity inter@@ ferences with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . at the end , you should always remember all the cables to go before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; you are in comparison with the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1@@ GB and you will not want your images to be in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between the operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst part is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ max@@ ing within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you &apos;ll see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors at low levels and are highly scal@@ able . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms using the fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
don &apos;t under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss for not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most analysts think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or re @-@ installation . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spotted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . this means that while technology continues to develop there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk is now available for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anyone else for data loss . so , 6 % of all PCs are affected by data loss every year . backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash fails you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget an aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time that such backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync is just the difference of files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; at the end you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete test . &quot;
&quot; metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you are really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every@@ time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have the scal@@ ability with plans and the area that you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it to a new record :
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command , if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bit per colour channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . DNG was developed due to the need to standardi@@ ze camera image formats . it is based on TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ ulations ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers get it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , but X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of usage and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera button , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it to your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a complex processing you can use external programs . if you edit the images back with &amp; digi@@ n ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these have to be cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them first in web galleries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos to &amp; digi@@ pack ; in the Ad@@ ding a photo to an album , you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to make your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , connect it to your computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . see the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display preview images . if this is the case , a fer@@ al indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be shown . some cameras do not display preview images . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file mapping for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. are shown on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information that are stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; the Metad@@ ata tab shows internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS , etc of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ pack ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; select the download button and download the selected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ pack ; in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of the existing albums is displayed as normal folders . the list of the existing albums is shown in the section My Albums tab . then , select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ pack ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete just a few , you must first select it and delete Sel@@ ected Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera , so you should check carefully if the photos were successful in a &amp; digi@@ pack ; it should be carefully checked before you delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera file completely , you should do this via the camera system , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day is created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the first two concern the data about the author in the standard auto@@ graph identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % M . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera file name option , you will have the option to change the file names in lower case letters , or lower case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ pack ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the side@@ bar metadata section , you can read more about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , you leave &amp; digi@@ pack ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , &amp; digi@@ pack ; this is used to automatically load sub@@ albums in the target album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a @-@ Data section , you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must turn this option on . use the Advanced tab and select the date @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the Download button . select then upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ pack ; you , where the images are to be loaded high . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder here and click OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position indicated in length and latitude is indicated and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ ic@@ ate an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ pack ; users want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data get into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle , and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a ticket module or by transmitt@@ ing data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ d or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical assignment . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the length and width grade or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters ha@@ iry coordinates , which are created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that make the behavior of &amp; digi@@ pack ; change . to access these settings , you need to select the settings dialog . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on net @-@ linked preview or image editing . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ pack ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s profession . these can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to indicate which the photo is offering . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture to other &amp; quot ; sources . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thus , it is achieved that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without lost . &quot;
&quot; image descriptions as embedded inscri@@ ptions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) store in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the inscri@@ ptions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ pack ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ pack ; trying to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in one &amp; digi@@ pack ; album folder that has none of these enh@@ ancements , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the illuminated by &amp; digi@@ pack ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you then open the light@@ box , these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or light colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation .
&quot; with the setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option of comp@@ ressing TIFF files , you can turn the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it does not affect image quality , because the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if you select the los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present , it develops very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option records the image a bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , which was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight on a white card . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top lights , as it shows the pointed white in the settings . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of missing information from the top lights . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ pack ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you choose to recon@@ struct the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding correction , since it is carried out during the tube conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how it should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space in the others to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
&quot; if a picture is opened in the image processing / image processing module , questions can be started using raw files . &quot;
&quot; create the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you can save all of your profiles . &amp; digi@@ came ; then examine these folders during startup . &quot;
settings of the ICC @-@ Profile you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma is not used for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given by a device . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . you could manually adjust this instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for you . unfortunately not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutr@@ ally , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; picture viewer and image processing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ came ; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; commands for tasks executed by modules , can be set in the Settings menu under Settings . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transi@@ tions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes switch on or off the metadata that is displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . these are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to make your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after setting up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any arbitrary code for your camera , which is displayed in the main window Cam@@ eras . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; Con@@ fir@@ mation dialog &quot; &quot; option for moving &gt; display images in the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ n ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to save the changes with the knob changes .
&quot; you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when starting the startup , this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m Start looking for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ came ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos to search . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ pack ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ came ; you , whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can select the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , please refer to this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ pack ; includes quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item Ads / Edit .
&quot; image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images , so some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ pack ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you should then possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery or button The Rest@@ ore image processing button in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last save . &quot;
almost every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by selecting Edit Rec@@ over or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same Album or the same key@@ word by clicking the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image up , down , or entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter into the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation parts , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple @-@ Click on the same rider the side@@ bar will appear or disappear again .
&quot; note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible , meaning that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling panel in other applications you should note these restrictions .
&quot; after you commented , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write metadata in the files . however , this is always executed when you selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
the comment section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ ding . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is carried out in the IP@@ TC Field . the enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the key@@ word used previously in this &amp; digi@@ pack ; -@@ session used key@@ word . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is further facilit@@ ating when entering keywords with a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , it is stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC Field .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this only applies to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section Reference Fil@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side strip is used with their Album , - Date , key@@ word and search results . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is indicated . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog box will ask you if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; the key@@ word filter is selected by C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was selected and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Various Items .
&quot; if you have a rule set up and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key term , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the colors used by your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make informed choices about color management at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( for more information see below )
&quot; your only other print@@ outs are per email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if the s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e shaped region , and colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to only work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must calibr@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB indicates that your ; on@@ itor relies on s@@ RGB , then you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting to process any further manual processing .
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alizing , comparing , automatic compar@@ isons and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous strength over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or well @-@ washed .
&quot; it is a very powerful operation , which either produces miracles in one image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic devi@@ ation : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible area and a rec@@ ess of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ pack ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . if you can perform the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Color White Balance of Image Processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen . preview will dynam@@ ically adjust the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; the hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images that most Pixel have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set allows you to save it in a text file and load later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original .
&quot; the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image can be set here . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available only for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the modification and allocation of color profiles . colour mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the magnit@@ u@@ des . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is useful when your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool color effects presents four colour effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; the coloured , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the coloured , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this effect was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the sol@@ ar@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally generates a negative image that is not produced on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sh@@ utter re@@ peti@@ tions the thickness of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can weigh the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you use the O@@ k button and you will be used .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you perform can be viewed in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool met@@ ering correction is applied to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controls , and take care of how the image changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . preview will be updated dynam@@ ically based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ im . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ outs can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change output values as well as in the input values . for example , compression of output values can be used for example to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values are stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values are automatically read@@ just@@ ed for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is tagged with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images recorded with a digital camera , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve part to the right , for example the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with dark@@ er output tones and that the associated image pixels are dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; to preview the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is shown on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shade and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to blend the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color @-@ bre@@ wing . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first . &quot;
save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting you can save for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was read@@ just@@ ed . the option to store lumin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves scenery , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
Rot@@ ary : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red line filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ary filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the shade tones . this is very similar to the process of getting a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ ia . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam , applying tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; add tools frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
to keep the eye of a spect@@ ator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you enter the desired frame type for your picture . permanently trans@@ forms the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounding it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative trim adding a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the goal picture with the frame will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially when you have used the tool After aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; apply mould sten@@ cil , you can set a template over an image . &quot;
the Picture St@@ en@@ cil menu apply in image editing can be used to place templates on a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add a template database , just send an email in English to the digi@@ pack ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the st@@ encils , a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nails of the templates . &quot;
below the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image placed under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically sound . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a colour point . this in turn leads to sharp edges a little bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when colored d@@ ots are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more supplementary sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . on the other hand , images in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
some scann@@ ers already use an Archi@@ ver during reading the image . if you disable them you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing movement . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate shar@@ pen@@ ing .
&quot; however , you should deal with it carefully because the results do not work very naturally : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image can re@@ focus . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ate soften@@ ing and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or amount hei@@ ghten the effect . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge affected by the filter . high resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft switch between the tones are exemp@@ t and therefore avoid ble@@ mis@@ hes in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing , focuses on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected dischar@@ ging filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot;
this is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a sharp@@ ness mask .
&quot; in practice the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module .
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the mattress size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the round@@ about sharp@@ ness or the gauge . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to do all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a greater neighbourhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
the result of the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is better at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ clear color image needs to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the knob smooth@@ s the bl@@ ur of the area of the dark@@ ened , thus creating a more natural p@@ up@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the ink ink provides a customized color for pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the default settings are enum@@ er@@ ated below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings of fine tuning , you can use the Reiter Smo@@ othing and Advanced Settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ining or CCD ru@@ stling a high value will generate w@@ avy @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing over all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally one or two ranges from here .
&quot; angle @-@ progress since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles have a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . however , it doubles the term . we therefore recommend it to be om@@ itted . &quot;
the button Save As and Load are exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a poor film shift during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise noise . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , for example from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny smo@@ ker that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings dialog can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius monitors the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area specified by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors are adjusted . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response of the filter . if it is too strong it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak or j@@ peg art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the image tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically smo@@ cked more strongly , but also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is tagged with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool for m@@ oll@@ us@@ hing with the menu entry cor@@ rig@@ ate soften@@ ing and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; Photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gra@@ dation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture rendering . the texture composition is performed using another tool , the image error correction , and the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm he creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ actor quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . each setting of Photo Rest@@ oration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ding on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; Hot@@ pixel tool allows Hot@@ pixel photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ planer ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wiz@@ ard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; when you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will see the last dark image and re@@ charges this automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also display this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary connection time under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera manually . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise unle@@ ashing effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s fil@@ ings and the color or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of an Center@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation in a rough image without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of compens@@ ating a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image using the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing from the menu Color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distortion . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s down to edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values are wav@@ e@@ form distortion . &quot;
&quot; for most lenses , the &apos; Corner &apos; has the opposite character of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus results in correc@@ ting first degrees . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; light : this value jus@@ tices the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
&quot; the sp@@ her@@ ical or wav@@ e@@ form correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then carry out a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be evi@@ dently the wrong . &quot;
&quot; in order to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal help line . move it to an important location , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently you can correct the sp@@ her@@ ical / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a wav@@ e@@ form distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool from the image processing or via the Zoom controls of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters to simul@@ ate movie gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Ad@@ option Ad@@ vice if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controls changes the amount of film gra@@ dation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green fields are white like snow !
&quot; as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infr@@ a @-@ red film , it makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared camera applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; Filter Film@@ filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ ining on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains in photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ zing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny image specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and style @-@ life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for big images . smoothing the smoothing or , from the other hand , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter carbon @-@ drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal @-@ sket@@ ch . the lines whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; Fil@@ ters engraving character@@ ize your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape . &quot;
&quot; depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
&quot; shaft blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is dist@@ orted with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image along star @-@ shaped lines that originate from one center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograp@@ hing from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
smart bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the colour font in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n by copyright protected algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use this option to select the area , e.g. a face , which should stay free . if you start the filter down@@ drain , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the mach@@ ined picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or twi@@ sts in proper orientation . the tools can be found in the transformation rotating or transforming mirrors . &quot;
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transform size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
&quot; if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ pack ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are enum@@ er@@ ated below :
&quot; when this setting is checked , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and loads are used exactly to do so . each inv@@ oc@@ ation for photo enlar@@ ges can be saved as text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear expansion .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
&quot; when you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cut button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save file from the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait format or landscape . in high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and the width of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio is used a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are cen@@ timeter , inch or some other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog two buttons have to be centered horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; in the dialog box you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio editing saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the co@@ hes@@ ion help make it easier to use aids , so that you can put your images together better . these help are : &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of res@@ emb@@ lance . like the third gel the harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden mean : the golden mean is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks designed to build your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; where each number is equal to 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is considered to be visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines if you put a picture together . these aids are enum@@ er@@ ated below :
&quot; in comparison to third @-@ party rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition results in the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral , creating a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that , in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can leave a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool for turning a picture around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you do not hold the camera horizont@@ ally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things revol@@ ve around an angle . you can do this by hand rotation and rotation free rotation . choose transform free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the settings on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences tab you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to position the two lines . now , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; once you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Transform@@ ieren zu@@ cch@@ ini from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is Automatic crop cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ s the image a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fix@@ ation point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right hand side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you to change perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transform@@ able area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transform@@ able area .
angle left corner : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transform@@ able area .
angle right down : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transform@@ able area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little bit dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; this is not rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; use your image by using Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and vertical angle . if you press on default settings , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the sea , a wall from a building on your screen and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the image will be a bit wis@@ er . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two layers make twice as much bl@@ ur@@ king and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the she@@ ar , the picture has tri@@ cky tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate these is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ pack ; requires a number of libraries and other pack@@ ets to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ pack ; &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to file a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; shows only files in formats to which you know . this happens through file extension and comparing them with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ pack ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the use of data compression algorithms on digital images . redundant information is reduced , in order to save image data to a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw material format , please visit Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ pack ; supports loading specimens only with the d@@ cra@@ w program which is included in &amp; digi@@ pack ; with this you can see more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of rough formats which are supported by &amp; digi@@ pack ;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format , but is not a film editor , and has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ pack ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to start playing movies to start playback . &quot;

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need to do the photo editing is in &amp; digi@@ pack ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , bl@@ ur , noise suppression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applying &quot; ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to display over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag the frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values .
the side@@ bar properties display the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or move out with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . move it while you press the left mouse button . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the Pal@@ etten files used by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the patch view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to generate such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse over pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m Curs@@ or is enabled under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing is selected . this mode allows you to select by selecting the check box over@@ writing under Bei@@ m Curs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color is followed . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , it can be past@@ ed as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color cho@@ oser on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Grap@@ hs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; included are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ art ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Grap@@ hs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; shows graphs showing all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ screen ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ Grap@@ h ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ;
load large graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ Grap@@ h ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ iter ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file is currently edited by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Pre@@ dat@@ ors ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ Grap@@ h ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ Grap@@ h ; instance , or want to present the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the existing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when starting the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also choose how the graph should be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the pieces of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph distributed on several pages , without head@@ line and with a different font &quot;
&quot; the Renew@@ al Download page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file was modified on hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( rel@@ o@@ ad automatically or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the seating management page gives the possibility to specify the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ Grap@@ h ; you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with one click on the main window with the R@@ MB@@ s , opens up more possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge @-@ over@@ laps as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ used graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to a multi @-@ dimensional scale . &quot;
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for un@@ ic@@ ited graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ cht@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ ene .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm comp@@ lies the node around a circle according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lic structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . using such a layout command , you can specify the graph file as a parameter , and modify the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . using such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms to modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;

reading the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the S@@ ane project or another source like e.g. video streams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; when you scan the menu item , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . here , select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ oth to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before clicking on the button to read the image . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you must wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears . you also need to select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image . &quot;
you can create screen shots after you have selected the Import @-@ in menu &gt; screen@@ shot ... a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen shots :
select the entire working area to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if you select all of your own program windows , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the entire working area , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog box will appear with the options described above . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool for export@@ ing your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , longitudinal and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; to view a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same places at the same location as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation carries out the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera capacity must be converted to GMT . this can be done using the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and camera @-@ time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have trace data from one place for images you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the inter@@ pol@@ ating options and the difference in minutes may be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the cor@@ relations button to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually using this dialog . this is useful if you have made a series of photos at the same location . as the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set by the displayed map . select the relevant region and enlarge it again and again , until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool for export@@ ing a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the player sel@@ ects all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option To create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; sk@@ ill@@ show &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all of your images . choose a folder on which you have a write permission . a sub@@ folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which of course also affects file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module generates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ ab@@ outs . it was developed for fast image viewing and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of color information takes place . for example , this can be found in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor does not have any documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out Ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool for converting a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow . after that , you can create the module into MPEG Slideshow . &quot;
the images selected from you are then listed under Image Files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your needs , you can start the creation of the movie using the button Co@@ ding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the m@@ j@@ peg@@ s and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the Settings button below . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is e.g. : useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your saved images to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w !
select the raw file to convert and launch the module . the Raw image converter window appears in the mode for a single image . using the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you &apos;re happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only permits a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif data . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . you can reduce or magni@@ fy the image : four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
&quot; proportional ( 2 dim . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
non @-@ proportional : di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is modified with this option .
&quot; preparing the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images that are to be sent .
&quot; after you started the module , the images window will be shown with the images selected by you . by adding the button images , you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place it in order to add you to the list of images that are to be sent .
with the button pictures remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures , you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached to the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
make sure you don &apos;t send too many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions for the size of e @-@ mails that are to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used each time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after adding comments to an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and sent to the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and don &apos;t want to change the photo quality . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original files will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; however , when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . by pressing the Cl@@ ose button , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL views in the presentation feature very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should test this before you show the presentation to your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random chooses a different effect on any transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date currently does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool for placing an image as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through these images , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now in each group , so in individuals , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have entered your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser will change . see picture . &quot;
this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
&quot; if you have selected all the characters , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of her name . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . in order to do this , you will need to select the picture @-@ view window ( in closer ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can customize the picture for the corresponding person . in the control window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the entry in the main window , a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialogue for setting the image properties . &quot;
&quot; the date can be either part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options at the bottom of the window , you can search all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , pictures on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather like to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and take a look at the Quick Start , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , in case you start your photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry of k@@ Photo@@ Album ; Demo . then , some sample images are loaded and you can try out the features of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name implies you will display date statistics on the pictures in your database .
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the one is written in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can access via the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before you create HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more closely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . no@@ c@@ turn@@ al information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is shown to the viewer without a description . for example , all images are being exported from a party . note that all images are being exported from a party . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set . so he can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
in this setting you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
&quot; best select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each succe@@ eding set . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if these are really all visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . thus , the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the currently described settings have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub @-@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time writing the pictures , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either create a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option on this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu import ... select &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; the exported database as described in the description .
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folders the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories will match those in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to search and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will step through the various steps of ( 1 ) placing the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ Album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top of its images . it is a simple XML file that lets you back up with a program of your choice , e.g. standard backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S where they want . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; remember the folder in which your images are saved and use it at future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window where you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained .
&quot; on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , there is a detailed help available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want . &quot;
&quot; you can also define your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in this section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialogue options , you can set up complete members &apos; groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the list below , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can access via the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared between several applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with the demo database . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you use it on your own pictures , using the command line &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that the modules are using over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview right now . &quot;
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums .
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category that you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , use the category people , it will be &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , if you would have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a splash screen as soon as you start your photo album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you have not entered any information about your images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the image , etc . you can select each image separately or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these ann@@ ot@@ ations when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , because you will always use them when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list . for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the names used are moved up , the persons find and assign them faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image separately , you might want to edit all selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub @-@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to sort it to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you can sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the strings that form the top edge of the frame , and you can also create your own window by drag@@ ging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... that allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
you can also om@@ it a frame completely . if you want to see this window later you use the Options ... and click here to remove windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
&quot; for example , see here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure it . try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , it is displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window opened with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the delete button or select from the Edit selection menu . now the window will show you that you can see in the picture .
&quot; photo@@ album ; it offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use the images somewhere , so that you can store the pictures somewhere , so that you can record the pictures somewhere , so that you can download the pictures somewhere , so that you can download the pictures somewhere . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and then copy it again . if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , how to avoid confusion of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those ones you may want to make accessible to others and click Current View in the Privacy Policy . alternatively , you can also choose all the images that your little sister can see , and choose the menu entry Every@@ thing except the current view . &quot;
&quot; with this you have set the pictures to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images to hide . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Policy . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can either read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not very familiar with the view of private images . &quot;
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; over a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
&quot; the viewer can see you in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the image , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box is on the top of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag it with the mouse and then place it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed . all these options are available right click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the full screen on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; using the Min@@ us button , you can zoom in the middle of the image using the Min@@ us button . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown . with the DC key sets the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos are that they are coming in and out with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can comment on the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to mark only the picture and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and view them as good or bad while you look one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features while viewing them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you are viewing categories in dre preview , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
to view the painting mode from the pop @-@ up menu . to finish the painting you just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control but documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understand .
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then the properties are shown in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . however , not the object of an already selected object , since all the objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the tool@@ bar icon or choose a menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the right position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you typ@@ ed invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the installation dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; if you want to render only part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can pull @-@ click these control points and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility level as a wi@@ re@@ model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected or the visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also store multiple window arrangements and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the star@@ ters to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the star@@ ters to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to view multiple views over one another , drag the star@@ ters into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map &apos;s top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the star@@ ters to the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing to the left in the landing strip . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... save it . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , it was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the Ren@@ ders symbol to render the rendering symbol in the tool@@ bar or select the scene view scene rendering . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender Mode con@@ forms to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender Mo@@ des from a fast preview to full @-@ images . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ des menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
each R@@ ender Mode has a name . you can enter any name but a name that lets you see the characteristics of the mode .
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality you can select the properties , which &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally pictures with this feature look better .
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this card , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the scene , select the menu entry File import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command set by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when you import error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Not@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply highlight the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the Community view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example altitude field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type marks .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the ground , a bottom underneath the objects is rendered . the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you select edge smooth@@ ness , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold . more exact details on the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . &quot;
the standard window arrangement option : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window arrangements list shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created using the add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Del@@ ete .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the add button and delete selected views with the button Del@@ ete .
&quot; with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with un@@ zip anchor the window under the existing window , with map card , you get a map view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ oring the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate yet simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you are only receiving a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you will receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; when you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
if you have installed all error @-@ free you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . you now have a scene without objects .
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later manu@@ als , but note that the camera in view has control points with which you can change the point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the App@@ ly button or the En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( Insert End body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view also shows the plane , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise of a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a simple one at the moment . &quot;
&quot; the pig@@ ment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property panel ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , you see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can preview the pig@@ ment only a matt black material because you need to check the pig@@ ment settings at any time . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set right now . if you ren@@ ame your image with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select a plain and change colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should be able to do this step already , as you should have understood the basic principles of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have already understood it . the ball can be created just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press En@@ ter or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering is now a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , insert a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the sphere , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , the sphere gives a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first , select the item and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection are already yiel@@ ding good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender Method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shot hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ews the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest item in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved is disc@@ ar@@ ded .
you can only select this item if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last one @-@ off command . you can only select this item if you have used Edit .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; command and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that can be used as blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies , and these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based by applying a picture file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
use of &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can use with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can choose whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you search for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box - &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of these , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be set . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . pres@@ et@@ ting is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; sp@@ ill@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still viewing the current image . this reduces the delay , when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option store &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; when you exit the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , you open this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can also set up a few of the file types that the program can also display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default .
determines whether the slide show should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation at &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards Short@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display can only be displayed in the short description .
display small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
display thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; open the input field for the completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; image editing ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ pack ; project .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ pictures , we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; show@@ pictures ; and hopefully soon you will be able to answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ casing ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ pictures ; . &quot;
&quot; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . bead @-@ wise should display the colors with what you are supposed to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; channels ; is an application for scanning images that can no longer scan and save images .
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer power as images to scan and save . &amp; channels ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner at the SAN@@ E project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search site : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite , with the command chan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and push OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; Channel ; quit .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not particularly treated .
&quot; to input a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ check and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the entire preview matches the window . &quot;
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview window in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the dialog box opens in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; channels ; to save images . open dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; channels ; it should be automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without using a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved for saving without using a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog box for &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; . the knob settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit and output .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other key short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up the global keyboard short@@ cuts .
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts , making your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; each K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow ex@@ ec ( ) to run external programs and commands . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , script can ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Command the script to display the setup dialog . in order to store and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now retrieve more information on the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ ers@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title Trail cap@@ tures the path to the selected playlist files when a custom menu entry was cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ ers Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to store dates or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks Script Management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b have . such pack@@ ets are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) that can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as e.g. my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ oc@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 only will accept script packages with the authorization of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script is ready , you can click on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and link to the Wik@@ i Scrip@@ ts page by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; apply . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag the music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Colle@@ ct Browser and the Quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; you may have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; normally , in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications some options that you can activate or de@@ activate at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty through the setup dialog . the Direc@@ tion dialog has several card @-@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le@@ . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design Full : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le@@ . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
transfer mood files to the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ les . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : you can specify the path to a different browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; when saving , the current playlist automatically saves from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist at the end of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date play on the part change , it causes the play@@ lists to scroll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize your appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by marking of O@@ wn fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey section is selected . you can select fon@@ ts for the following range : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set up your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing at the start causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece in place , with which it was stopped at the last exit . &quot;
&quot; set up the On @-@ Screen Display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colours for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog to select color selection . if used colors do not use , the default colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of the plac@@ eholders available and what they mean . &quot;
the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to set on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers activate even more settings in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub @-@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the cross@@ bars and their sub@@ folders to search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists may appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected there is another installation in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
to send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; similar performers recall : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be retri@@ eved in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file by logging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
&quot; most of the time , it is because Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib Developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more sophisticated . &quot;
&quot; make sure all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; but with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but they do not label as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the per@@ l module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply cli@@ cked . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version , or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
you can also help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; it is not suitable for any kind of help . please enter only one error , if you have something about the fault of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist appears . how do you enter music ? &quot;
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere in the new review column to specify the review for a piece . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short commands . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove From the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist to the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , next to the add @-@ button , the button playlist is to be saved . click on it . &quot;
probably the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config utility is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check for lib@@ visual . this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question loud which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ ative reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the sink sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and provide simultaneous audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide another sink ( e.g. , sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d only listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with the highest possible priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning ! see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ab . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then merge all the ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &quot;
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . furthermore the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you are awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped prior to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; see current titles when you are on another computer ?
if there is a functioning SS@@ H environment you can proceed as follows . this command gives you performer and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identi@@ fier is present in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA .
visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size variable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click row into the queue . by pressing the En@@ ter after a search in the playlist the first search result is played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control panel ? &quot;
&quot; with the R@@ MB@@ s , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers you want to display . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS disk . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; to normal read , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take files from folder mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;

&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence has each individual evaluation on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the review of a piece as well as all other attributes , by clicking with the right mouse button on the item and edit : edit comment , or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the comment in the dialog metadata . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want you to specify when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that will not match the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find annoying . des@@ elect the option icon when playing anim@@ ating in the general settings .

Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is completely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you must configure and install this output modules .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you have to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package separately . you now have to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package , and you need to install and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator register . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok ... enter the device . typical is for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

&quot; in the x@@ ine dialogue dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio edition with Arts is not going to be taken care of . you can of course take care of this issue yourself ! if you want , you can become the new ( urgently needed main@@ tainer for Arts ) : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save it by using the button playlist to save it . you &apos;ll find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ lists window . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the play@@ lists of your collection and you have the option to import playlist players , you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select the audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button play . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audio@@ CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have various options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installing some software packages . the packages required are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( eg , RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control .
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display , which displays the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . one click on this section changes the display of the time already ex@@ pi@@ red for the remaining time of play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ sers , even under the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard , and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , larger window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display are the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the PL button is activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting up E@@ quali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classics to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preference . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ Q check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub @-@ windows will later become more detailed in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window will fall away . the information shown there is now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music window displays information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbols . click on this icon to match the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information on the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images may have any name , but images with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display cover pictures which are either downloaded with Cover Management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . if no text script runs , you can choose which to start . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script required .
the Search button opens a search for google.com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter - only groups the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter / album - first the pieces are sorted according to the performer , and below it will be another partition after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group performer / year - album - sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection will be sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by performer .
group@@ ing genre / performer / album - this setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you have something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly below the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions on how to use this filter can be found in the playlist section of this manual .
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box , which allows you to filter out the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select your total collection from the last 24 hours to one year . &quot;
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This cle@@ ars the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
&quot; on Media Player , Add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be shown . &quot;
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n Pi@@ eces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selected album as a compilation , after which it appears under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the album will then no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the playlist browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the lower part of the play@@ lists is smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time , the smart play@@ lists consist of : &quot;
never played : a playlist of the pieces in your collection never played before .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click &quot; &quot; Add smart playlist &quot; &quot; to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window media player is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , you need to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Performer , sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list of performers . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / music@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z enter and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachments of files can be helpful through simple drop @-@ down . in the case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : thus , dropped files are inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired location and drop them . as soon as you enter the characters , only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then wrap the key@@ word with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something will search for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syn@@ tax@@ ies at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment pool .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you can add the button Add to which you can add the playlist to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons are followed by undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore any changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up your configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for tool@@ bar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be obtained by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the playlist on the menu . you can reach the Settings by &amp; Amar@@ ok via this menu . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plugin window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
&quot; behind this entry , a sub @-@ menu of links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok is hidden ; &quot;
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the Cover Management . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have more control over the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the plays will be played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add the queue a piece , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can easily add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ set ( the details for setting up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( previously : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m Profile to make this dynamic playlist working .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them into the play@@ lists window , or right click on them and then select the store . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes Hits mix and play@@ lists mix instantly popul@@ ate your playlist and you can add playback directly , and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of items , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New button delet@@ es the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog to edit the playlist settings opens . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be passed and you will not hear a piece dou@@ bly double in that playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces are removed in observ@@ ance of the settings of play@@ mate pieces . &quot;
&quot; plays - this is the number of plays played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each play played . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts make your own settings . you can customize the settings by launching the script and then click setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install a script by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please see the Writ@@ ing Scrip@@ ts section . &quot;
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plugin is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin simply enable the check box next to the name .
&quot; this Quick Start guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when re @-@ coding to MP3 you will receive a bad quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check whether an audio CD is created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in only four steps . to track the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can follow the progression of the copy process . once the origin@@ als are finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium for which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules can not be found . to fix this problem you can start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plugins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback on community help from the forums and learn news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD contents ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that are also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; and therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality with burned Audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis deco@@ ders and enco@@ der modules .
&quot; it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Dec@@ oder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder based in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to burn them afterwards to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a help program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a auth@@ oring system full of auth@@ oring , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and Super Video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level , for example , for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording tiles of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is shown with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to save for each project file .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project that is not stored , just as if you were called for each project file closing . &quot;
closes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ stored project is asked what to do with it as if you have called file closing .
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view in the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button firing , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above . &quot;
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project .
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it just displays the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can burn later on . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning in place of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying @-@ di@@ alogs is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; opens the dialog to format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ eously by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , enco@@ ding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . when an entry is checked the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
&quot; when this is checked , a small strip is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , the content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking of the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ board is a narrow section , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks nice and separates the project view clearly from the other views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change key bind@@ ings for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the mapping procedure below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and adjust the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality , therefore your taste and type of task will be decisive , which of the programs you prefer . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the d@@ co@@ p command line utility . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all have in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Pro@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Pro@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mod@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mod@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mod@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then receive a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
&quot; K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) : &quot;

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily record audio CD ; s can be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that coding these wa@@ v files ( These Ko@@ di@@ erer packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ress into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ ding / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to extract audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection , it is not possible to handle any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while the setup needs to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of the user interface is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; may &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , with everything manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step , you can find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB query on the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB Register . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the enco@@ ding settings in the setup directory - the enco@@ ding .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the standard . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the enco@@ ding settings in the setup dialog .
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for coding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main directional dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high audio quality ( with high bit rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG players is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music should be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stere@@ otypes . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame _ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information which is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , and the enco@@ ding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt is from l@@ ame and the title parameter by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; co @-@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information instead of entering into the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( referring to the translator : with this the author is meant ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in this mode of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address when retri@@ eving data from the server is not used ( This can only be the programmer know who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the next mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; in the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less comp@@ ressing for audio data ) are on the enco@@ der tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . further information about enco@@ ders is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switch by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key words ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write permission ( eg by trying to copy it with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to use the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it for any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name will be passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the recordings of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card general settings . here , there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything can be c@@ locked / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , select , so that you will be informed when data for generating key@@ word ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , it can easily be changed . the directory or file name is changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , please de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is a fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as regards the server , as many fire@@ walls use the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want to give any &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server should be enough . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check out this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are saved . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resul@@ tant bit rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ c@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ding wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to coding more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successful data collected from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , look in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully removed from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current Title &apos; input field , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be isolated for each individual commentary , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot ( e.g. whether all words are starting with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of one piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time by tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the CD @-@ editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the box list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark in front of each row of one piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . just make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the Select button to read the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the posts and follow what happens . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that are not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the job list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , reading and enco@@ ding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found any configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of high @-@ performance machines , the result is un@@ clear . the used calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you are reading this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs if it is running , then the following is true for you : &quot;
a program that calls for many different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any locking point as it should proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it ? who reads this probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you want to add or change something useful , may it do it . at least after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; curi@@ ously , if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er by &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke in real @-@ time recording of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ not ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa will be included as soon as there is a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so that it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically det@@ ects the process used .
&quot; seating support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , k@@ mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid windows . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with multiple pieces it is added to a collection and then played after each other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is played , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ va and thus change the playing speed . to reg@@ ain the original speed again , double @-@ click on Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item Pause at the menu , then inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and other both . some pieces do not have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events should be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected , which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the menu Settings . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files that you sum@@ mar@@ ise . in this section , you will see how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the collection section under the item Organ@@ izer .... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then enter the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs in the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the items in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when applying the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . then , this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is set . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump on a song , select the next song button , add the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ LE ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE Key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE Key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that DE@@ F@@ INE is used to indicate that a section starts ( except OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can provide in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
&quot; in this section , you will see how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shooting . to do this , use the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 regardless of what audio is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here the term &quot; &quot; drum &quot; &quot; is meant to be a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which clay means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map tones to the percussion channel . see for example the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to exchange some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , do so easily in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful in order to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this will be converted using the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that the map file doesn &apos;t stand dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives out that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards will try to play two tones up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you change an instrument , the knob is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the item Channel View : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of each song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; that allows the same MIDI file to play on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or play it ( if I play a MIDI file ) or play it ( if I play a MIDI file ) or play a file , just move into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to quickly listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program further on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;

&quot; my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on its homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile a sound card with MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as to playback DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE Website for new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
&quot; the use window is made of so @-@ called and@@ och@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional level of hierarchy . if you click an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked record . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist using the playlist and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected , without equal to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; due to the ease of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during startup and exit can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ scene option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at startup needs not be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ bound &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L can be supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example of how to play a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to allow the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the Con@@ figuration dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , it must be done manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all the og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play cards from TV , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be checked , the device can be used to use the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recor@@ ders ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialogue is in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ elite &gt; V@@ DR &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the enco@@ ding to be used must be figured out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be stored in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ version , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ers , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , you start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there hints on how to sof@@ ten my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine only starts slowly but why do I need to check my CPU every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ all@@ y. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs the last stored value automatically , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes a compilation of &amp; K@@ ile ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems most likely rely on the package &amp; text ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be consul@@ ted .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the K@@ ile ; website should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you compile a / K@@ ile compilation , please contact the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; working area . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , the easy to use assistant , the lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management need to be called . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its options the guide to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate there directly with reading the chapter .
&quot; for lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it origin@@ ates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; here only a good old view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ begin { document } , and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Assistant by &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers a few options for the creation of the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
&quot; document Cl@@ asses : hereby the type of document to be produced is selected : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , Brief &#91; book &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aps &#93; , Volume &#91; DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aps &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; proj@@ ectors &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or custom @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; coding : with this the enco@@ ding of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be chosen ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they need to be selected only in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN @-@ regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; K@@ ile ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is most likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; with automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( to enter the text ) and the associated line to the rule of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( apart is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files may be very helpful when using a DVI ; file &#91; device @-@ independent file ) &#93; , jumps &amp; K@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the available output ear@@ t by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the corresponding passage is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding place appears in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others is simplified .@@ tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file will be &quot; &quot; super@@ fici@@ ally &quot; &quot; and no inv@@ oc@@ ation by &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick installation . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is for quick structuring of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the selection box For further information is available for entries such as keywords , code notes or references . the available options include : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a description for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( choose from a selection field ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written naturally also in &amp; K@@ ile ; manually .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ r is used for defining the font size . the font sizes can be set for the main text , the joints , etc . &quot;
&quot; when you call &amp; K@@ ile , there are two options available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ DVI class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the Kn@@ op@@ f speed@@ bau . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document is missing , the logging should be searched for errors . when using quick @-@ build , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed . &quot;
&quot; environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size is created and only a few places should have a different font . &quot;
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no description ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain types of fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cour@@ ier pressure , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands are either executed by the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the ital@@ ics print and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { ou@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed in ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is represented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile follows . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments should be done for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
DVI ; is a computer independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different kinds of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set properly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into corrug@@ ated other formats can begin by buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preview function allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this only Modern under Settings K@@ ile must be set up ... tools for building balanced .
&quot; in order to search for the previous search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and will be cli@@ cked on prior text search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then performed then . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; K@@ ile ; as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if a bug is missing , a error may be found . if there is an error , it will be summ@@ arized in the log file or message window . &quot;
the log file speci@@ fies the error source in the source code . in the editor you can then use the button Previous La@@ Te@@ X Error and N@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between errors . the log file must be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for fast creation of a new document . more information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by pressing a existing document and selecting file template from document ... create . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set in the K@@ ile settings ... settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps will be performed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the default . &quot;
template Object could not be unser@@ i@@ alized successfully .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and emphasis from many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; K@@ ile ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its possibilities , the guide to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly there directly with reading the chapter . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; and their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ big@@ ski@@ p just \ \ par will be selected .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with twi@@ sted Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to search and emphasize different kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ulas are distinguished by another color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards can add additional marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ Ã ¼ Ã ¤ ge editing br@@ amps or the relevant keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump mark is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities are added , in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is added ; special commands for their selection . &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning implies that tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; K@@ ile is that the passages are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also sel@@ ects &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a recur@@ red line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to remove a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the Edit selection paragraph .
it has already pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; K@@ ile ; for further commands under Edit Environ@@ ments for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , it will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environmental commands , you can quickly lose the complete overview . this command complet@@ es the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X Group are some important commands that match those from the Edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the curved stap@@ le .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cl@@ asp .
if the cur@@ sor above or behind the cur@@ tail of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a lot of ne@@ sted clust@@ ered groups @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps you can quickly lose sight of the above mentioned group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions are used as GÃ ¤ n@@ se@@ ¼ s@@ schen . for the pur@@ pos@@ eful implementation , the sign &quot; is used for two simple instructions . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double pin mark can be set up under Set@@ ting K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; you can also use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , and there@@ with German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when using Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( for example the enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , and K@@ ile ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , t &amp; K@@ ile closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Set@@ ting K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ulator in the above line . although this tab does not belong to the associated table , add some intermediate space for the column position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code completion offers , it has been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , there are three different modes available for automatic processing . all these modes can be set for different modes of work under Pre@@ ferences ... &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new environment by the command \ \ begin { Environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to gr@@ ind the list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are , of course , be removed by selecting a command . alternatively by &amp; K@@ ile ; also jump stamps are available , so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing br@@ ush@@ marks N@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ste jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be entered . &quot;
&quot; under Set@@ ting K@@ ile , set up ... K@@ ile ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . there may be different rank@@ ings for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as parts of general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for completing environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and calling the complete mode will result in a large number of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for understanding the environments available . &quot;
&quot; when calling the tran@@ sit@@ ory mode over the menu , or the Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . thereafter , the environmental disaster can be continued in the simplest manner and termin@@ ated by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be included . &quot;
&quot; under Set@@ ting K@@ ile , set up ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the bug list for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; Supp@@ orts custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations that are immediately replaced by shorter strings . the lists can be set up under Pre@@ ferences ... K@@ ile can be set up . as an example of a check list the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l serves for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word tran@@ sp@@ os@@ ed mode Ã ¼ ber@@ th abbrevi@@ ation or pressing C@@ tr@@ l + Alt ebar button is replaced , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; however , it has been noted that many documents are written more than once in a document . thus &amp; K@@ ile ; the complete registration for all already written wishes . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the K@@ ile menu ... ile can be switched off . here you can set the threshold for the notification of completion .
&quot; the execution files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / of the personal home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics reflect the inser@@ tion of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be followed and taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted using ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating compilation , Cre@@ ating converting and Gener@@ ating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key @-@ key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after the compile . if no visible viewer is used , a new window will be opened each time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... This is why the following information is available for the project :
&quot; when the file name window is selected , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ led@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered over scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed end@@ lessly and can be used in further versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
first you have to say that the execution environment of the script in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&quot; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; are supplied with a lot of documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is an all @-@ round instruction for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the documents and documents delivered and included in a graphical surface . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; K@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; K@@ ile ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; K@@ ile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X. &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who seek the progress of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project , and offer dozens of hours for the development of tools that we all can use under observ@@ ance of the GNU ; license . &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor for managing many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface you create acci@@ dental sig@@ natures or daily sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature from the signature file is read by &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many sig@@ natures with different quotes , styles and information , you can design your emails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day sig@@ natures , the same signature from the signature file is read by &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , you will use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures , you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty sig@@ natures ; in the sig@@ natures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty sig@@ natures ; and enter your new signature . signature @-@ example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org http : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natures as you like . then you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then delete it in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross remove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button and enter the new short@@ wave by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for the use of &amp; casual ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 needed . to attach sig@@ natures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;

a fil@@ en@@ ame can be an absolute path to a local file . or only the file name ( eg ; x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l ) .
&quot; a pre@@ p or mod@@ us@@ name can be a fully qualified name , where the non @-@ local part is optional , e.g. x@@ s@@ l : my@@ template is referred to as &quot; &quot; my@@ template &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first click the delete point in the list of current holding points , then press the button Clear . &quot;
&quot; the status of a specific holding function is displayed in the corresponding text with another background color . the desired color can be selected : see the Edit Editor Options dialog , on the Color dialog . &quot;
&quot; you can set , de@@ activate or delete a holding point using buttons , the de@@ bug menu or the symbols in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the biggest part of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is tr@@ apped and either shown in the Insp@@ ire ... Dialog or at the &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; output window . the following exceptions apply from this rule :
&quot; the various tools are available via the Deb@@ ug@@ ging menu , whereby the Insp@@ ire tool is most important . &quot;
&quot; by clicking &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; in the menu , a dialog for selecting the running speed is displayed . &quot;

all found templates are listed here . it must be noted that the export rules of &amp; X@@ S@@ LT apply . therefore multiple templates can be present with the same matches and mode details .
clicking a Template entry in the shown list moves the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a map map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g In@@ spec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ S@@ LT source code where a global and local variable is declared
&quot; by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable indicates a specific expression , for example &quot;
&quot; if it contains , a new XP@@ ath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter is moved in the main window to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; the 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; All these tools use comp@@ ut@@ ations as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as sub@@ strate . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows me and how excellent it is . if we still need one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click the symbol for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the war@@ p work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the desired folder in the other folder field . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already mentioned , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened directory is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then you simply do the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , their file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then the current file is simply hoo@@ ked . if not , delete the tick on current file and select the file to be checked using a different file - file selection . &quot;
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is formed click the Well @-@ formed Review Select .
&quot; for the use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; specify the definition of definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system will benefit immediately and do not need to wait until someone builds the plug in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . more details can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin with the Edit menu item . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables to manage all the contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to locate the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often , several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email messages are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves as a unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and press the button as pressed . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears as bold after you are : text .
nickname and setting of their own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is done . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . one example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much anyone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that will add a file to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail is sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note to enter a comment is simple . it can either be chosen from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word in a comment field followed by the comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where the nickname is the nickname of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader After the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the relevant area or sub @-@ project leaders should be given as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialogue extends over a few pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this . entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lower case means the tags are inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ x@@ ml files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal sized / lower case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ x@@ ml files .
&quot; include optional tags : if an@@ onym@@ ously , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and end date automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic set @-@ up of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using the Standard Ret@@ ur@@ ns the standard specification can be restored .
default character enco@@ ding : coding of newly created or otherwise used as file opening files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting is backed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editor area or own view ( or the documentation in a map ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface has passed through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
warning messages section serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more .
&quot; the place around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in its shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when manipul@@ ating and how deeply when modi@@ fying the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be vali@@ dated for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause sh@@ orth@@ and does something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a stand@@ still like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) , or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; loading Compon@@ ent in &quot; Only Read Mode &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is not ref@@ unded . only Read @-@ Read Parts normally refuse loading , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the input given is correct . des@@ elect allows saving the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left D@@ ock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . normally appears in the lower D@@ ock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is shown in the lower D@@ ock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it divi@@ des the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
&quot; in@@ stru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continually send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , the execution continues . happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; in@@ stru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , the execution continues . happens before a de@@ bug is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is asked . &quot;

&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that can be found at http : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many more works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how to help you to become better .
&quot; documentation type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for market@@ ers and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills such as car completion and sound trees ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , which &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ x@@ ml files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic bars of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can be inserted faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag@@ x@@ ml files are to be created , then description &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag@@ x@@ ml files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the contents of the property dialog for the tag . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags to a document without danger of writing error .
&quot; tag folder are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ x@@ ml files . tag folder enter the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of tag@@ x@@ ml and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ x@@ ml document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but an element type above itself . &quot;
the type of the tag is a script function . when used it becomes &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common Attri@@ bute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
is the source code used for filling for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a intersection and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can happen only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
defines the attribute text position within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each case ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags defined . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements that end one day . this item is a single element type .
all tag@@ x@@ ml files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the tag@@ x@@ ml files the tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check can only be done when loading the tag@@ x@@ ml files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 tag@@ x@@ ml file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ x@@ ml file should be schem@@ a.@@ date .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 tag@@ x@@ ml file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ x@@ ml file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; int@@ eger &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as fairly simple and there is an editor for it accessible via DT@@ D re@@ processing DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Ver@@ nal 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 transi@@ tionally ) . if not specified the name is used as a nickname .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action to the same dialog :
&quot; this action assigned button abbrevi@@ ation . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut button can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current short@@ cut is removable . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that modify the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpreter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we have replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used by the external script .
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the selection field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard error output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the output sel@@ ector output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the brand @-@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . choose settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill all necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable dialog &quot; Edit tag &quot; when available , so that you can enter when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edi@@ ting size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will insert ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of desired action . next to the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there is any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us functions to the tool@@ bar or you should set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool bar to set dialog through Settings tool bar . make sure that the tool@@ bar you are looking for .
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
for example I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by testing all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; back up in the correct folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust its descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most desirable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
before you start your own documentation you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done this for you .
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file , then we &apos;ll let you know the second part here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html tag@@ 1 &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit to the depth of chess ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
&quot; the contents section is the domain of the doc@@ cr@@ c file which is used for designing the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of HTML code elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and ad@@ mitt@@ edly to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local / global use . then create a folder ( like you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share with other resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different locations , you can send an email menu entry like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archives , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and Script tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the author of the resource . &quot;
it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is supported by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in tag@@ XML format . there &apos;s the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D to a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can start from the DT@@ D File and Conver@@ t a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
target Name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tion@@ Line : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after the conversion : if enabled , adds &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are stored for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from tool bar through actions everything that is selected as a global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the joint use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the blu@@ epr@@ ints , the cards with information and tool@@ bars . please refer to , and for more information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , such as the current , other or all map makers , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the editor area to another context menu regarding the edited documentation , such as cutting / copy / paste , editing the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
&quot; if you want to insert a tag that represents multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the construction managers ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow the information to be navig@@ ated to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the display with card holders are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation building views . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project . more on templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information on the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can use the information available to a script , such as the script to start , edit or send with E@@ Mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can view the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking a element , a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree will open . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other buildings . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the content aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site can be downloaded , you can create your own documentation and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed on project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are indicated .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are expan@@ sive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the production side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool bar in an email , you can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other , and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . to do this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers began to deal with a close idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would do ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why developing , which has already developed someone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need for their needs . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost any task possible . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in depth documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest record is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there included special characters to &amp; HTML ; sp@@ elling , so that it is displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .

&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows , for example , to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more on / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .

a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved through settings actions ... or you will be asked when requ@@ esting if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment . &quot;
enables loading of tool@@ bars to the main server where everyone else can access them . see in .

&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are present in the currently loaded tool bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu default in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to bottom , for example after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the machine address of the machine you want to access , except you can edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ amp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , let it be included . if a project is started anew , not an@@ hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a detailed selection according to credit fertili@@ zers . &quot;
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or by removing the tick from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window profiles or change with the Shift ; F@@ 7 key .
some settings are similar to those in the Project Wiz@@ ard and are described below . additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to the above , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened . it can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this way , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button . in the case of troubleshooting . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can turn event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . you cannot influence this behavior at present . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the Project menu or the project icon open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well ; however the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right @-@ click pop @-@ up pop @-@ up menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent the removal . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk cache option is not in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project Tool@@ bar Project menu or by the Project Tool@@ bar Project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one can do most . this not only helps to increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best illustrated by the tool@@ bar menu . usage and adding differ . adding tool@@ bars is described below in the Ad@@ ding tool@@ bar section . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , where new action can be created , tool@@ bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bar to be executed , where actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates are basically used as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the pre@@ p tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in roughly the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
&quot; binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . for more information on the Templ@@ ates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be written by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents are created in corresponding sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the Templ@@ ates tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template but the same text area again and again in the documents . you can find it all , from a comment on a final note to a complete menu on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the Templ@@ ates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save As local template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the pre@@ p room under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File Save as template selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used to drag and drop or paste via the con@@ quer@@ or file tree .
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click on a folder to the right and secure site template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can preview he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically merge with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files presented in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a drop @-@ down box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zed as soon as el@@ ter@@ al attributes are acc@@ ru@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; if a root folder is set , it would disable templates in this path , unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a root folder . &quot;
this could include general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to copy contents templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , using the context menu ( to show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; code editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL editor .
the V@@ PL editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back if necessary to the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . it is not necessary to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time changes both in the source editor and V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ izes and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ izes the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta .... Acc@@ ording to the choice of V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small chip for fast calcul@@ ators and a large margin for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , you can choose the document properties . thus , the editing of invisible tags in working with V@@ PL ; editor is also called . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL editor is created . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows changing the content such as keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to create the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button , selecting the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a text editor , by moving with arrows . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of return key or remote key . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , any other surrounding anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the table wiz@@ ard or Listen assistant are disabled . later , they will work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to other styles for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to make &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . why so &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts while mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added later .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , just copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it into one of the windows . &quot;
&quot; a function that made much work , was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser . &quot;
this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when automatic selection of the correct changes . the merge editor under the differences windows allows you to edit the result even directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in case of folders :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and le@@ aning against the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance when someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o Target Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Target Fol@@ ders
&quot; opening dialog allows for manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; using the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if A file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting up / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts instantly . in opening dialog , you do not need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag &amp; drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
note : at present you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window contains the info line . the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + Z. B. are white characters only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , seldom individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summ@@ aries column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is checked , the line will be shown on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame , and &#91; changes &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatically bringing together text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the kno@@ bs to the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; conflict resolution ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers , or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , down , side on , side , beginning , end , string start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the Insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the section Mer@@ ge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ g image ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , conflicts must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker into the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is enabled , you automatically copy the clip@@ board and manually copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the clip@@ board content . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car res@@ ume + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically during the exit and restored at the next start . ( set Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in the recur@@ sive script . if the chosen script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ast@@ ly represented . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically adjust@@ s an un@@ even color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press En@@ ter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual into the clip@@ board then . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are ignored . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a cart re@@ mark &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others in turn save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the cart @-@ return character is made visible , but then this option must be disabled . during the merge , this option has to be de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; inten@@ sely search for smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will proceed . &quot;
&quot; this is useful if white notes in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic sel@@ ections also include conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are handled in the chapter on scanning by folders and performing a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version of the suff@@ ix .@@ original is added . if such a backup file is already existing with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it is deleted without further f@@ use . &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not concern the currently running program . you must stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally over the control center . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
over the selection fields for enco@@ ding appears a short note what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
customize the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable you can compare and merge files with different enco@@ ding .
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the enco@@ ding of output commands . &quot;
disable this to supp@@ ress changes in white notes in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences will be shown in a color co@@ ded over@@ lay column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will display a second check column with the information needed . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply finish the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then commit ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when using the command line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
the \ \ 1 in the string string matches the found text in the first cl@@ ame pair . the \ \ U converts the found text into upper@@ case letters .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ equ@@ .@@ sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;s , per@@ l just needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the line @-@ off algorithm is looking for .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... make a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and shows the simulated changes without having to perform them
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message panel on current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files are listed , which have been compared to that time . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
every file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by double clicking on the + / - or double @-@ click on the object , or by double clicking the arrow buttons for the left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the coll@@ ision action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of any problems of this type again . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; however , with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then folders will also have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ t@@ ff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist then mer@@ ging cannot be started .
&quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified , and when the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged together and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such bugs are not eliminated , the merge of the folder cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file is processed after the other . status column shows finished when the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages if something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the Direc@@ tion dialog the file comparison method is selected , cavi@@ ties will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge action ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C will be used as a target in the Three folder Mer@@ ge mode B as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all the entries you should be in the destination folder can also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries , select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut button ) . to match only the current item , select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if there are still invalid mer@@ ging actions by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options through , simul@@ ate and break down . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs specific actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re done with a file , select the directory merge to start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , an appropriate dialog appears . then , the next entry will continue . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , leave &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be summ@@ arized . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called Directory Mer@@ ge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( for example * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match that pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig . * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig . * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous poin@@ ter marks a file than hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links display . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is disabled , the links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not refer@@ enced to possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare just the date of change and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution with caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to confidence to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal . this can , for example , be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; to synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so selected that both folders are identical . also the results from mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as action instead . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension , it is deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of single files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder mer@@ ging view remains visible during the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text boxes . &quot;
&quot; you can also create a single file directly , without first having to merge the folder . to do this , you can create a single file directly , without first having to merge the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this for reading files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax for local files and folders .
&quot; a path may be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a brief list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be differentiated if a link shows a file or folder . then , a file is assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible on local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as the difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ . view from the pop @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in the patch file . then it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diffusion Part . furthermore , it is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or adjusting the folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools called K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ el are Komp@@ are ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL programs very long and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who went this way or go it like that .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not told the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE does not find the resource for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if similar lines appear next to each other , this story is not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this story is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this has been too large so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis is conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how you can use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install on a system use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure you can find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift + Insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
&quot; only view differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the feature Update after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are shown which show differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change its size , to stop it or move it . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , you can move windows inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement can be moved both inside a desktop and on other des@@ kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and exit . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and exit . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other des@@ kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops is displayed . &quot;
&quot; checking this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1. desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the folder . otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally makes &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , as well known from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows stores ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very well suited for presentation side@@ ways on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings ... allows the dialog box to appear .
&quot; at the moment , it is not possible to change the settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as pic@@ tured above . the main window appears as magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window appears as magni@@ fying window . below is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( dro@@ p@@ down window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following manner : &quot;
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you also press &amp; Shift , push or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window stays firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , store it to the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops actu@@ alization of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , low , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set @-@ in commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , no@@ vice ( using the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Zoom &amp; etc . &quot;
it may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the screen printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visually handic@@ apped .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; has been developed by Olaf Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ user@@ s.@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster for@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor with@@ holds for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and each mouse click aching ache .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor with@@ holds for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of every mouse click aching ache .
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain created when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all the ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . &quot;
&quot; this dwell time must reach after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mou@@ sec@@ lick . &quot;
&quot; for Intel@@ ligent shifting on , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wa@@ its before it release the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . a slow moving to the left and back brings a double click . this moves will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can and k@@ de ; to sh@@ orten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you set at a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times . &quot;
this setting is selected &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; Start . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
&quot; reset all settings to the values set before opening the dialog . if you already press the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent move should be switched off . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mou@@ sec@@ lick remains without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore use the mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty easy . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse button , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you need to take the mouse button . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . it should be clear however , if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scr@@ ape with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the intelligent move , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot be quit by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you yourself run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue to work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to have it . but do not park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard . safe zones for mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with smart moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very possibly possible to mark text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent move if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , press the Shift key and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will each time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case in most of the systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click the mouse cur@@ sor as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and which the actu@@ ation of the mouse buttons is causing pain .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a drag operation to begin before the mouse button is released . in this way , the drag and drop down with the mouse can be performed . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that dum@@ b users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list containing the conversation sequences that are to be discussed again .
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shot ) enter the command , which is later used for the voice output of text . for more details , refer to the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text@@ book text@@ book . from the text passages , you can select often used text passages without having to tap them . the passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ p . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word list . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have a mouth ; correctly set , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select from these sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu Entry Pre@@ face ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two map cards , voice output and settings , the side of Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ p as well as the Page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the language output input field , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding to be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text should be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders here : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . &quot;
&quot; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ line text@@ book or in the bar for text@@ book di@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of In @-@ In @-@ Speech , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added to the memory cache . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector for text matching book , you can determine if the text@@ book book should be saved automatically when closing the edit window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text passages , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book text@@ book will not be saved . choose before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ one page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ one . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the language you want ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Docum@@ entation . in addition , you can compare the list of words with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly issued words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main section of the window is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the text@@ book di@@ aries are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passages or short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text@@ book script , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add actions such as new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books , you can either go through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or through a drop down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the flow storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the flow storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ ander . &quot;
&quot; when this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default through the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; when this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; when this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text matching books is displayed with entries . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open Pre@@ ferences tab and enter the language output command on the voice card language output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for more details . )
&quot; the festival is a speech system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to further distribute it without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ettes folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be switched on .
&quot; the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ next language service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the language generator setting only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to set @-@ up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully using a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the person who cannot speak , can print text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is saved , which the user can spend again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer must be a speech synthes@@ izer installed .

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database by &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ops ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . you can also subscribe to the list of https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . you can also find the developers at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install tool speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set it correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; on the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card @-@ card spokes@@ person is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card @-@ card is displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should at least set up a speaker before you use it , since the speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are similar to multiple printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the flash@@ card reader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card @-@ card spokes@@ person is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all previously set actors appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list is also their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; select here a type of tuning , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ons ; almost use it . go back to the Card General and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service is started by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can click on the map chart to create and manage text messages . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map of the cards to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed , and you can create and read text messages . see . remove the marker , TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , goes &amp; kt@@ ons ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ons m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start , stop , stop and record text messages . &quot;
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card orders are displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map and activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that is to be read , and select the Text from the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can ski@@ p this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; preview lines and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the enhanced text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that is to be read , and select the Text Editor main menu . then , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works when it is embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , noti@@ fying you of events that you have set . you can also read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nickname appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program K@@ noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu Settings menu . the settings for K@@ noti@@ fy vary depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the news that sends K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before being sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for the improvement of pron@@ unciation in order to replace wrong@@ ly spoken words or short@@ cuts , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and holds those orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the queu@@ ed orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that is used messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text read on a website you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who is just entering the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications are also news .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you receive from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text messages . lyrics are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ons ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and stopped . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can either be specified as words or regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ons ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string substitute filters that enable replacing chat em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages out &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ons ; some X@@ S@@ LT files are included in the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can send orders to a speaker , depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent to the text . if you have set a female voice on the card board , you can read text by K@@ DE message about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be processed , it is processed by all enabled filters , which were set up on the bottom . the processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in turn from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below . &quot;
&quot; for the setup of string substitute filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name at any time , it must be distinguished only by the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column correspondence and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replace . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text job speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages by pressing the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button at the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ DB ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied to 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box of this filter apply when match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all text . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; XML ; trans@@ former translation &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ings . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , it is also sufficient x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the card board or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties , which gives the program the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; and with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it by clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you are looking for . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box of this filter when apply . you must apply at least one condition .
&quot; voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ DB ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output bar via the &amp; D@@ DB ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of the text to read and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start kt@@ own@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so SA@@ B@@ LE does not work at all . &quot;
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ing f@@ aded . what can I do about it ?
&quot; first of all , make sure that the enco@@ ding option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , they may be remedi@@ ed by a string replacement filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ons ; you can find it in the kt@@ ts@@ d folder . you can also find the source code of k@@ de@@ accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; KT@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages referred to above may be incomplete or obsol@@ ete . therefore , refer to the page of kt@@ ons ; for information which is not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend the use of a different synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you get the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ accessibility , or have downloaded Tar@@ ball any night you have created , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , check first whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf@@ . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is divided into single sentences . the user can go back , repeat the sentence or reject , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise it will automatically be chosen the best suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about it , see how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; Map &quot; &quot; tab , and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the map card reader device is displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details of the modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text enco@@ ding for text passed to festival . if voices , which &amp; kt@@ ons are known , this setting is automatically applied . generally speaking , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider , you set the volume , speech velocity and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot choose some controls and these grey are displayed , the voice you have chosen does not allow the settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is more quickly synthes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or simply click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed by kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ons m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application that has placed the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card board . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can advance or return on the job that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the map card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text messages are listed and managed here . screen @-@ readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; click here . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , you have to compile and kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , or you cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; place the microphone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ GBP , % about twice normal speech velocity . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to figure out what device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text job is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ons ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader was read , the queu@@ ed orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that reads messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just want to read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who is just entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers unless they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ noti@@ fy messages , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card board notification appears . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the read of &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fy noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and des@@ kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , there will be al@@ erts when a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the conversation and conversation ; when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; should do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , who is shown as the top entry in the list on the card board . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the default noti@@ fications like this :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for selecting text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voice , speech velocity , volume , sex of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ons ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ GBP , % , SS@@ ML text usually is very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / sym@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &quot; http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / sym@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &quot; http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / eth@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &quot; &#93; &gt; &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus , you can start or stop using the whole text job , not the whole text job . this allows you to start or stop orders from the flash@@ cards , even if the speech synthes@@ izer is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set limit recognition filter . at the first start by &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add additional syntax detection filters , but beginners will get rid of it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by try out . switch off the speaker selection and select text to read . to do this , check the box selection , change some properties and check how the speaker selection changes . to do this , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; the first set must be processed more quickly , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time . &quot;
&quot; then you can stop or cancel text messages on the card board , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit recognition filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ular characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set @-@ line recognition filter keeps the strings attached .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ale ) , warnings , messages , or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set limit filter by mistake , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in it . &quot;
you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the card board . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card board speaker ) . in other words : no subscri@@ ber properties are defined .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker showing all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , choose this speaker . otherwise , select the speaker who is closest to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the speaker &apos;s properties here . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing . &quot;
tick this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as prime property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker selection button and then use speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input is 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr cuts off immediately when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get any trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and kt@@ ons ; it has been termin@@ ated . you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I stop a text job , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the console appears a message that states : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA that prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices add the new voice . as a guide , you can add a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ formats filter , and set up the microphone speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ons ; read the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . so the festival doesn &apos;t make any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber shows the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags . &quot;
&quot; I added an own string replacement filter , and now I can go back and forth in &amp; kt@@ ops ; the order is shown , the order exists only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for sign detection instead . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the command station register . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ons ; also freezes when you stop a text job and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 a@@ Co@@ de does not support real breaks . if you stop a text job in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current sentence will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the microphone speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ et archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball to a matching folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or created at least only on request .
&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of them have run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . &quot;
&quot; as default is &amp; kt@@ ops ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

&quot; before using the synthes@@ izer , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . for help , please refer to the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read Web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for those voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions when passing on . &quot;
voices are still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you must enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 bit ) enco@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore you are looking for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA synthes@@ izer . then the festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it produces the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a full voice file system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate this phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German text slides .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wr@@ apper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files not in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder are installed , but in the file festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German festival &quot;
&quot; you will find instructions in the file RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of error correction is not necessary , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 won &apos;t work with I@@ MS German festival . &quot;
this method uses special code to give the language over festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; grab and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure they both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech by

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create for the user a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and enables the setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installing and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network configuration module is loaded when the option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index option . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited for distribution and release . by marking the setting non @-@ recur@@ ring , the definition can be taken permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode . previously , all options are gra@@ yed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system administration mode , you can enter the system administrator mode at the bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the network interfaces will be used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the tab &apos;s network interfaces :
the selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button &quot; &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; &quot; displays the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the option Manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask , the sub@@ net mask is set . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the server , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switch off a disabled network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface . &quot;
&quot; establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requires http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .@@ or@@ g. , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be shown to add New Name Servers .
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit ... Edit dialog will be displayed . &quot;
the list of name @-@ known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS server is available . in small and closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
&quot; normally , the list of name @-@ known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar machine and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the familiar machine and click the Add button . if the known host has several ali@@ ases names , press button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of an especially well @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Cl@@ ose Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used as a k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended by experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second one will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . &quot;
this section cannot replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is provided in a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently concentrated on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is attribut@@ able to a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person to use a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , so any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area from 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 451 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the standard route is required for the IP transmission . &quot;
&quot; the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it is not surprising if any other content is found there in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by default through the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config , which is a different state than expected . &quot;

&quot; the default k@@ de ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose to fold out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
print the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced authori@@ z@@ ations .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ on@@ tab to change the schedules of users . &quot;

&quot; the first consisted of creating several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective extraction . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ l the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . do not recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; tape types must be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive needs to be form@@ atted before using it , it must happen before you are form@@ atted by the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after finishing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start securing the backup , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select Files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are saved .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can re @-@ establish the restore , the files that are to be restored need to be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be rest@@ art@@ ed . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file on the basis of the band content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
&quot; as a result , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is created . you can make the following settings for a backup job : &quot;
the current folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all files listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up , such as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems , can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then have changed . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file prior to tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ winding version of the tape .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is bound , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , attempts to lock the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work at all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the band is loos@@ ened ; automatically the tape is ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape form@@ atted it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only contain one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , whereby the name of the system is the complete name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the period in which the band was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with GNU ; - tar . even other tar -@@ versions should work as long as it does not involve incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides information about your system . in addition , it enables users to quickly access information about problems occurring on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system deposits the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a range of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions provided by the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start attempts to open &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . it will not be shown with system administrator rights , most likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log file , for normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string . in default , the list of the log rows will be displayed automatically , so that only log rows are displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter search term is matched only with entries in the selected column . for example , in the log file system protocol , select the column process , and additionally , enter the name of a process in the log file , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log rows that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the key log rows . minutes lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as minutes lines of level hint . the colored representation of minutes lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you would like to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the launch of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can check the option To start new lines from the main window in the pop @-@ up menu in order to view all new protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. where you can find more information about the sources of loading and k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system quickly becomes the standard for controlling program start @-@ up during the boot of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re @-@ installing and re@@ format . that &apos;s why you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc rather than directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort , r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change this , then you can manually repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
&quot; this would stop htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; . in addition , I could have a user @-@ run@@ level , the &amp; gt ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start ( or stop ) at this level .
&quot; you can also move the script between running levels or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry will be removed from its original running level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you drag them to a new level . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it in the target area -- even if the same item has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ um@@ bers of the surrounding entries before you can again attempt to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to recover items thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before exec@@ uting them . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are retri@@ eved from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ds , and now the machine is rest@@ ock@@ ed . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO @-@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode , then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running on Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the proper directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated without a message if their configuration files are not present or mis@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you make changes , you need to save it . either use the appropriate symbol of the tool@@ bar or save the item in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two map cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialogue user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created , where you can make individual settings . additional card cards will appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card file password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
this card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group file on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field constra@@ int file system .
&quot; the card board provides information about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , belonging to the user , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s dialog features contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select add from the user or group , or click the appropriate add button in the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ loader , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , alter operating systems , remove , alter , and more . &quot;
