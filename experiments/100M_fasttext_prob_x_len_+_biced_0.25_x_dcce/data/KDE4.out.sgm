<seg id="12">"to view the DOM tree view in the & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and thus open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Modul & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists in representing nested folder hierarchies using a so-called Tree-Map. tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"at & FSView; the size reflects the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, you can easily recognize large files, even then easily, as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle that is switched to color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or if the area is used by minor rectangle (whereby therefore representational error may be used by the sign of the staircase). moreover, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"setting algorithms for Treemaps should generally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treviser in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is possible to divide the areas so that rectangles are created, which are as quadratic as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive sections."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the floor space for an entry over the menu entry point view on space. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry."</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipack; visit the homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digitikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for notifying in the developer mailing list by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you start & digipack; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path names or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the databnk will be saved. this path remains the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digipack; you will additionally use as an old library. presets digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder containing images as a base folder. no image will be changed. while searching the folder you will get a progress display like this:"</seg>

<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up and set up your digital camera. afterwards, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword iste to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported camcorders in the Help of RohkameraAssistance."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh Decoder2 and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digipack; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digin; together."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk drive. older cameras may also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"photo2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that support a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras. gphoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digipack; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to read the preview images of digiKam. the Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera drivers to read the preview images. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may possibly see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digipack; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plug-in Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digipack;, PhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview to develop. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digitised; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in & digitised; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the only limitation is that a picture cannot be displayed in keywords, data list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, RAW, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename works only if this ind of the symbol view is displayed. what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos, which are saved by & digipack; are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard disk, by the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties, or by date on which the album was first created."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add or delete a collection from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collection settings."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"the buttons Elders, Average, New Testers: these set the date on the one of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album."</seg>
<seg id="92">Sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select" "Add an album preview". "in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to place it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be scrapped.</seg>
<seg id="95">The collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifiers in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album for the first time, you need to wait for a moment while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this in which you can recreate all preview images in the Tools menu."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is, you can change the digitised settings; select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digipack; works. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to this. you can view all the functions that come with & digipack; you can choose between viewing the images or slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Image Editing... or select the contextual menu of the image using the right mouse button and edit... in the digipack section; Picture Editing lets you view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">"it may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button, and customize the program from the submenu from the file type."</seg>
<seg id="103">"you should note that after editing by other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the picture may occur. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc."</seg>
<seg id="104">& digipack; provides two options for rotation. the easiest is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>

<seg id="111">"tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lipiquot; to fold, so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="112">"keywords are saved in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs."</seg>
<seg id="113">"you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button, either on & quot; My keyword quot; or on an existing keyword, and then select new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will become the foreword of this keyword."</seg>
<seg id="114">"you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword using the right mouse button and selecting deletion. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo."</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and select the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword quot;.</seg>

<seg id="118">"this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also use the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and choose the keyword from the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="119">"you can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event it has been made, etc."</seg>
<seg id="120">"once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window as thumbnail."</seg>

<seg id="140">"another mode is better suited to select quickly out of a picture series. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same. now, use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images."</seg>
<seg id="141">"of course, the normal delete actions also work directly from the lighttable like e.g. F4 file editing...."</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">"in the lower end of each area you will find a built-in pivot function, which you can recognize at the crossed arrows. in order to rotate the visible area of the picture, you must click it and hold the & LMB; pressed in mode, both pictures will show the same image area."</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works as well as in other views. just use the zoom control under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and forth. this happens in both images if you are previewing in the mode.</seg>

<seg id="150">"the first thing you do and you need to know before you merge anything into your system is the structure of information structure contrary to data structure. you need to decide if other access to your photos should be stored on your computer, or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point."</seg>
<seg id="151">"maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you do enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% working files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>

<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">"this setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance, which was photographed in the sunlight on a white card."</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the default is the top lights, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights, as it shows the pointed white in the settings. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the top lights."</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digipack; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you choose to reconstruct the option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted for each image."</seg>

<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason you use a color-managed workflow is the colors used by your camera or scanner. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should make informed choices about color management at any point of the image processing workflows."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (for more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other printouts are per email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if the sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe shaped region, and colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting to process any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalizing, comparing, automatic comparisons and contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminous strength over the whole picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"it is a very powerful operation, which either produces miracles in one image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic deviation: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">"in contrast, this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible area and a recess of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digipack; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure occur. if you can perform the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Color White Balance of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen. preview will dynamically adjust the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"the histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images that most Pixel have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one colour channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set allows you to save it in a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original.</seg>
<seg id="406">"the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image can be set here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is available only for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the modification and allocation of color profiles. colour mapping can be done by the subwindow for the magnitudes. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is useful when your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digipack; tool color effects presents four colour effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"the coloured, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light. the coloured, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light. this effect was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solarisation. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally generates a negative image that is not produced on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shutter repetitions the thickness of the neon light. in large images the filter can weigh the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result you use the Ok button and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you perform can be viewed in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool metering correction is applied to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide. concrete the three slides below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into and moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">"the easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controls, and take care of how the image changes."</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera, linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammaim."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinouts can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change output values as well as in the input values. for example, compression of output values can be used for example to create a bleached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values are stored in the filesystem and loaded later. in addition, the Gimp level format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the option overexposure indicator controls all colour channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is tagged with (1) and the corrected picture (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images recorded with a digital camera, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a curve part to the right, for example the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"to preview the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is shown on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance channel. shade and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digitikam; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to blend the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color-brewing. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first."</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting you can save for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">"the option overexposure indicator controls all colour channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digipack; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"the sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather psychologically sound. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a colour point. this in turn leads to sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when colored dots are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more supplementary sharpness than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. on the other hand, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners already use an Archiver during reading the image. if you disable them you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening movement. you can use the menu entry Corrigate sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should deal with it carefully because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image can refocus. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen. use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry corrigate softening and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or amount heighten the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge affected by the filter. high resolution images allow bigger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft switch between the tones are exempt and therefore avoid blemishes in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">"the & digipack; tool refocussing, focuses on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected discharging filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe."</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a sharpness mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">Sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module.</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the mattress size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the roundabout sharpness or the gauge. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to do all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a greater neighbourhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">The result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is better at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image needs to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the knob smooths the blur of the area of the darkened, thus creating a more natural pupil."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink provides a customized color for pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings of fine tuning, you can use the Reiter Smoothing and Advanced Settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is smoothed close to 1 in one direction. if you have a film graining or CCD rustling a high value will generate wavy-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing over all. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally one or two ranges from here.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-progress since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles have a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stepwidth [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation use: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. however, it doubles the term. we therefore recommend it to be omitted."</seg>
<seg id="527">The button Save As and Load are exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the journey. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digipack; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise noise. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, for example from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy smoker that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"the following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings dialog can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius monitors the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the area specified by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors are adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubricate occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the response of the filter. if it is too strong it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak or jpeg artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the image tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which are typically smocked more strongly, but also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase jitter absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, can remove noise and phase jitter at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is tagged with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool for mollushing with the menu entry corrigate softening and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digipack; Photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film gradation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or retrospectively digitized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture rendering. the texture composition is performed using another tool, the image error correction, and the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm he creates some compression & quot; Artefactor quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and store exactly this. each setting of Photo Restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniformity noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on a Ilford (tm) 700si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grading on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>

<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line for a 1-dimensional interpolation.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="568">"many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary connection time under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera manually. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unleashing effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposures of today's filings and the color or grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation in a rough image without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controllers, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image."</seg>

<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens down to edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the coefficient of fourth degree corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values are waveform distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"for most lenses, the 'Corner' has the opposite character of the parameter."</seg>

<seg id="597">"with the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>

<seg id="600">The & digipack; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and style-life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for big images. smoothing the smoothing or, from the other hand, the hingness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machined is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the & digipack; filter carbon-drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal-sketch. the lines whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start with it."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">"the & digitikam; Filters engraving characterize your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn."</seg>
<seg id="607">"the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondaring landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the modified image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">"with this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn."</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: splits the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">"shaft blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks."</seg>

<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of sharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: wipes the image along star-shaped lines that originate from one center. this simulates the blur of a zooming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: wipes the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: wipes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographing from a car or train, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: wipes the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blurring: finds the colour font in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn by copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can use the & digipack; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use this option to select the area, e.g. a face, which should stay free. if you start the filter downdrain, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the machined picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it through mirrors or twists in proper orientation. the tools can be found in the transformation rotating or transforming mirrors."</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The Cimg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transform size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digipack; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"when this setting is checked, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the buttons save as and loads are used exactly to do so. each invocation for photo enlarges can be saved as text file, and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="638">"inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear expansion.</seg>
<seg id="640">"editing a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">"when you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cut button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save file from the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait format or landscape. in high-format, the larger value of the height and the width of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool After aspect ratio is used a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are centimeter, inch or some other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons have to be centered horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">"in the dialog box you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool After aspect ratio editing saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the cohesion help make it easier to use aids, so that you can put your images together better. these help are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of resemblance. like the third gel the harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mean: the golden mean is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks designed to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; where each number is equal to 1: 1,618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is considered to be visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines if you put a picture together. these aids are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"in comparison to third-party rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition results in the view of the beholder along the line of the spiral, creating a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. that can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can leave a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers."</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color, you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool for turning a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it's easy that you do not hold the camera horizontally or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things revolve around an angle. you can do this by hand rotation and rotation free rotation. choose transform free rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the settings on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences tab you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to position the two lines. now, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"once you have shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transformieren zucchini from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is Automatic crop cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the Anti-aliasing option smooths the image a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixation point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right hand side of the dialog, you will find some information which help you to change perspective:"</seg>

<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little bit dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing."</seg>

<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set. so he can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a picture bigger, he changes to a higher resolution."</seg>

<seg id="940">".kim files are normal zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option on this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size as the .kim file would be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to search and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it, you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured."</seg>

<seg id="960">"the applications that the modules are using over KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications are just a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum."</seg>
<seg id="962">"it simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview right now."</seg>

<seg id="1092">"the wire model view also shows the plane, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon."</seg>

<seg id="1112">"when you raytracen a scene, the renderer shot hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renews the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog. thus, the scene pixel is processed for pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1113">"as you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the image is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera."</seg>

<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information which is manually entered or fetched by the program from the freedb over the internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / used with & kaudiocreator, and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt is from lame and the title parameter by & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & co-creator; parameters that can be used (= button identifier in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information instead of entering into the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (referring to the translator: with this the author is meant) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted."</seg>

<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code....

<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined encoders. further information about encoders is found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switch by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1545">"you need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do."</seg>

<seg id="1557">"the second drop-down box is easier, a & CD; entry is found, starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, it can easily be changed. the directory or file name is changed with konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, please note: if you want to manually enter everything manually, please deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map card."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates General-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of type Change patch to Trumpet, and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have one soundcard, you do not need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM -KOMPATIBLE (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END DEFINE Keymap "Name of the keymap..." END DEFINE Keymap "A further keymap..." END DEFINE CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">See that DEFINE is used to indicate that a section starts (except OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can provide in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, you will see how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"for example, if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun shooting. to do this, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shooting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60 regardless of what audio is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here the term" "drum" "is meant to be a different percussionist instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which clay means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map tones to the percussion channel. see for example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to exchange some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, do so easily in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for Keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful in order to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for Pitch BenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted using the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that the map file doesn't stand decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives out that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards will try to play two tones up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you change an instrument, the knob is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu in the Settings menu under the item Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of each song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc; that allows the same MIDI file to play on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>

<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML-languages currently not by & quantaplus; it is supported by creating a DTEP package. the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in tagXML format. there's the easiest way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package automatically.</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in quantaplus, there are some key concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;"</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are stored for anyone who uses & quantaplus; from tool bar through actions everything that is selected as a global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the joint use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the blueprints, the cards with information and toolbars. please refer to, and for more information about these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document, such as the current, other or all map makers, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right click in the editor area to another context menu regarding the edited documentation, such as cutting / copy / paste, editing the tags under the mouse pointer or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer."</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole web page & etc; there are all possibilities open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project. more on templates is available."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information on the available scripting languages. the concept of spin-off in Global, Local and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can use the information available to a script, such as the script to start, edit or send with EMail."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. why so & diff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time changed the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts while merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, just copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made much work, was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; when automatic selection of the correct changes. the merge editor under the differences windows allows you to edit the result even directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in case of folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and leaning against the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance when someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both of them differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2295">"using the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be initiated. if A file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"when merging, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting up / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts instantly. in opening dialog, you do not need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag & drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, it would be a relatively big effort."</seg>

<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window contains the info line. the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window.

(if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)"</seg>

<seg id="2306">"when differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + Z. B. are white characters only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, seldom individual cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the summaries column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is checked, the line will be shown on broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename, and [changes] when you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatically bringing together text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled!!! (use the knobs to the next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually."</seg>

<seg id="2512">"when your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty easy. the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse button, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse button."</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to recreate the band index file on the basis of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">"as a result, a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is created. you can make the following settings for a backup job:"</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all files listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up, such as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems, can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then have changed."</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file prior to tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-winding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is bound, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"if the option is enabled, attempts to lock the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work at all tape drives."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"if the option is switched on, the band is loosened; automatically the tape is ejected. do not use this option for floppy."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"the option is turned on, tried & kdat; the hardware block size for the tape drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to share the block size for your tape drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only contain one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">"the format of this string is hostname: seconds, whereby the name of the system is the complete name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the period in which the band was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar -archives, which can be managed directly with GNU; - tar. even other tar -versions should work as long as it does not involve incremental backups."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system provides information about your system. in addition, it enables users to quickly access information about problems occurring on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system deposits the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog provides users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a range of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, it provides & ksystemlog; functions provided by the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start attempts to open & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. it will not be shown with system administrator rights, most likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log file, for normal users usually do not have permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or string. in default, the list of the log rows will be displayed automatically, so that only log rows are displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter search term is matched only with entries in the selected column. for example, in the log file system protocol, select the column process, and additionally, enter the name of a process in the log file, so show you & ksystemlog; all log rows that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the key log rows. minutes lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as minutes lines of level hint. the colored representation of minutes lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you would like to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the launch of the Samba server. in this case, use Filterbar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can check the option To start new lines from the main window in the pop-up menu in order to view all new protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. where you can find more information about the sources of loading and ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system quickly becomes the standard for controlling program start-up during the boot of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without re-installing and reformat. that's why you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc rather than directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort, rc.sysinit and the following more folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change this, then you can manually repair it by restarting the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script is invoked with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc;. in addition, I could have a user-runlevel, the & gt; & kdm;, network & etc;."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move the script between running levels or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry will be removed from its original running level (or its position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you drag them to a new level. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it in the target area -- even if the same item has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sortiernumbers of the surrounding entries before you can again attempt to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to recover items thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the various workspaces (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before executing them."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are retrieved from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runlevelds, and now the machine is restocked. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the LILO-Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode, then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for running on Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the proper directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated without a message if their configuration files are not present or misconfigured."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you make changes, you need to save it. either use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or save the item in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two map cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialogue user or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created, where you can make individual settings. additional card cards will appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card file password management appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the quota.user / quota.group file on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the field constraint file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card board provides information about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, belonging to the user, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the Group's dialog features contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select add from the user or group, or click the appropriate add button in the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works similarly."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module, you can install the LILO bootloader, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, alter operating systems, remove, alter, and more."</seg>
