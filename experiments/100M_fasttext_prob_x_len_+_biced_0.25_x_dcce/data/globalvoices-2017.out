&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time now . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican &apos;s letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who supported the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a law student . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was like it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very black@@ ish love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never keeps his mind behind the mountain as he says so beautifully .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in multi@@ tudes for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican presidential elections , was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party has ever reached . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s world@@ view was not in line with the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits with the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump turned his way to the nom@@ inees Repub@@ lican presidential candidate they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the pres@@ idency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tr@@ ump voters than R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom know , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those looking differently from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; pu@@ n from white in reference to wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means s@@ ling trau@@ ma ) , as the great Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America that promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a manifestation for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; laugh@@ ed the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , it is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca co @-@ operate with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ aly@@ a ?
&quot; the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular with tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for several years now La b@@ anda de m@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become central in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot , who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you will always be laugh@@ ing and playing with shiny eyes and playing in the tur@@ bel you will learn to play trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , map@@ le , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero the children of Cat@@ aly@@ a - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - are based on instruments made from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion all made out of tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ aly@@ a , remember the early days : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something , which he had never seen before : a violin produced out of waste . &quot;
today there is an orchestra which plays instruments from re@@ processed material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic MÃ¼ll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about a billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played its music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing .
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication will take place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia , before it opened the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law @-@ break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to run one of their har@@ bors and refused to give it a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at the time . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there .
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ under@@ ing the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which outlines criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 founded by the NGO stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network were the six countries that had driven Premier out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are inter@@ connected and work together . they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species should be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i watches the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , such suspic@@ ious routes can be discovered - such as those who suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the previously mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated 20 million USD of lost sales , which lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of the illegal fishermen entering east African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . under these also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of fan@@ ta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately explo@@ de the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 research of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conc@@ eal their activities and position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO that deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , whereby they can no longer be located by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system connecting different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ag@@ ulating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime Organization of Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project to run in which a global system permits tracking of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships that previously had been f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa every year several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim of even more such initiatives and structures is to be made in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report its first great triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also steep@@ ed in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; using measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; this is another success for F@@ ISH @-@ i . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the world .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s office .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on its mandate , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes closed the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , gathered in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the RÃ¼ck@@ er@@ or@@ ber@@ ung Venezuela &apos;s ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - including Bar@@ inas &apos;s flat land area , in the An@@ des regions of MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the provinces of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the Federal State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate as a result of a acute lack of food and medicines in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the office of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the attitude of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % of the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ lowing Day as well as a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , planned on 3 November , should continue to be suspended . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national civil strike and on 3rd November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores &apos;s Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; The Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the images of the fairy tales , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also con@@ front@@ ations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently asked pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I have Hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell about con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves hit the news about police repression in the central @-@ northern city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves against the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government according to their own statements . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise they could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes a round , which forms the amount of suppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a National Assembly procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview given by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , who was originally published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qu@@ ij@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he kept family sec@@ rec@@ y for himself . &quot;
in the situation back then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ ry officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in the prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he experienced as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows what great power a parent has over his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with one of the ERP systems . &quot;
just think that they will not take you one day and I must save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; that is why he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be ok .
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are being tort@@ ured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; he took me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I stepped in and saw a lying on which people were tort@@ ured .
it looked like a water@@ bed and a metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied there .
&quot; they rarely hold a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ end@@ able ... like a dirty win@@ der .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated and blind@@ ed and blind@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian that was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down@@ wards - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ded still on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you look like as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there met a man and killed .
&quot; according to the survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was accused of death by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this road and were tort@@ ured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
at that time at the age of age I had no idea what the &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military badges that one fought against an enemy that was fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... steal , then this is not war spo@@ ils , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal all things in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who st@@ ole cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roller co@@ il@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense was accused of being a conspir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the body is the last disgu@@ sting act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a lifetime . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with him , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself again and again : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been possible to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what &apos;s their cor@@ p@@ ses to disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom one could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last disgu@@ sting act that one can do to a person .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crus@@ hing and disc@@ ar@@ ded somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I saw how you killed people !
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I simply said the truth about twenty criminals - including my father .
the thought to display my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ ach for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly dism@@ issed and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed horrible crimes and you were forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; Well , let me die . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I ref@@ unded the first ad .
at last I realized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I have finally testi@@ fied against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : under severe , irregular imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 especially serious cases , torture followed in five cases , and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old . &quot;

&quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment . &quot;
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes against 7@@ 16 victims since March 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended sentences of imprisonment and nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the initially 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .

&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driving license . &quot;
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long its driving licence , witnessed a very particularly ab@@ used translation in the last month . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ bel@@ sha ) , the &quot; older driver &quot; means , wrong@@ ly , but perhaps also with vi@@ cious h@@ eck &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; aw@@ ful car &quot; translated . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to 20th .
&quot; edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was made to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto @-@ appearing newspaper Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News deals with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; d@@ read@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an inadequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved in accidents worldwide , however , is a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , which corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the repor@@ ter , named by name , brought comments to light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is the ( &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; If the translation isn &apos;t really bad at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a true translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , who can produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still make translations into company @-@ internal . then , the Japanese collabor@@ ator , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made for trans@@ lators , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the pro@@ ver@@ bial and mysterious pro@@ positions which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest British form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards you can expect more careful translations .
&quot; in the future , Kyoto takes advantage of a more serious source of translation . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the &quot; Nav@@ navig@@ ator Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
later other users wrote that the websites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
websites Venezu@@ el@@ an ISP seems to be locked again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ L in@@ filtr@@ ated later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; when a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server will respond faul@@ ty or denied the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS server : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third sent channel , was hired on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , a lot of girls become slaves to get a training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child in Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects witness testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who became victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Fall schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof above his head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children will have to make countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice , referred to as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay on account of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , as the feeling of gratitude inv@@ oked the Cri@@ a@@ del guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who is their daughter in the belief that they can finish their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , was given a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of fierce pun@@ ches . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of former military personnel Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n , until she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift enquiry into the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the Life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Ru@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to go all work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time that she was still time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polish the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more leisure she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she did not get in@@ definite food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the host than eating out of the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , standing next to him and reading edi@@ tori@@ als of opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; while he was intelligent , he did not talk to her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would again &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; . &quot; that said , that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would speak at home again Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose .
&quot; however , she was fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to criminals when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents has a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I had no circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clearly that I belonged to no group . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and p@@ ests in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group administrators are P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please register .
starting from Monday when possible .
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town of Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a five @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the interior , who wants to work . &quot; &quot;
then the author of the message pic@@ ks once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I just look if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ ani and to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to go into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill design@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

public Domain CC@@ 0 is published .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently voted on a draft law on &quot; the regulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt by a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established , which is commissioned to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , it could be a punishment of up to six months in jail or a fine . &quot;
&quot; the bill consisting of six parag@@ rap@@ hs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft has no indication on how Egyptian authorities want to impose the registration on users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior researcher &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that , as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means they will be set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case . &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees , before proceeding into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Parliament of Parliament Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten &quot; &quot; thre@@ aten public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ator H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild bo@@ ar is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out in sheer joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to passion@@ ately reveal another aspect of her country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies for wild living animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region .

&quot; a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma fired the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung is based in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a good pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate have been ev@@ acu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost whole coastal cities from the map .
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , alone , alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the life of the local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the paper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
&quot; housing Construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , altogether 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( in the Ra@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ signed ship@@ yards ( which is the case , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is trying to reloc@@ ate into final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple cal@@ am@@ ity , nearly 8@@ 0,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated who hau@@ led after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident killed in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agri@@ cul@@ turally .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear prolifer@@ ation zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is far out@@ stri@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants think it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a general picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains : &quot;
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it is for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent spare @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 state of 2017 , more than 40,000 residents of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their native pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones who still dwell in shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if you meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspective and remember that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
&quot; Kal@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has soli@@ di@@ fied the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being hit by the police in nationwide demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday he had beaten a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a strike against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
&quot; on the pictures , there is also the face of the police officer to recognize who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the examination of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stick to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media campaign of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ atri@@ sts shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he had supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
none &#91; go to You@@ tu@@ be@@ .com &#93;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to the police force against prot@@ esters last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; member of the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators using loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media had tu@@ cked the road protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window wind@@ screen . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported about a broken glass window in order to illustrate their cover pages illustr@@ atively .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of thousands who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
this must also be recognised when it is strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines entitled &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Dest@@ abili@@ zation of For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the popular church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ ig@@ ne@@ es and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back into operation after a long period of in@@ active time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members carefully that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane plant would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a subject of concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway sti@@ ff@@ ness of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and they were hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes . &quot;
only the factories left to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the Report &quot; Agricultural Econom@@ ies &quot; published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Food and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , &quot; that was the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane Factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats the most &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of preparation , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; officially Collec@@ ted documents , which would only differ in relation to the parts that were removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was transferred and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the mis@@ placed factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories left in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for reti@@ ring in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
Cuba &apos;s most developed industrial area was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated in the communities in which they were . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ese learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane plant closed , or rather than they began to dem@@ ol@@ ish them , they also stopped to hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ es other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without prospects , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month , to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a lec@@ turing person , yet he for@@ gives the lies they told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ menting him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes for 65 years in retirement , not because it lacks force , but because it is em@@ bit@@ tered . &quot;

&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this via hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshops are launching mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e communities in Montreal and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop thereby increases that the young participants talk about topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ cycle dance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribal of the Kit@@ sw@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street section in western kan@@ ada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered . &quot;
&quot; for the most part , the cases were not solved . &quot;
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages , although the you@@ ths are not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ st@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the you@@ ths involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop band , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in translation , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody will ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day you will hear our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth .
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth .
this is how they can do what the Creator has appointed
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in sy@@ ll@@ able copy ( which is also published on his blog and will be re @-@ published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( which is the most important in the country ) , outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of every dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers view these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even attract them . however , a new trend is turning today into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic pan@@ ties decorated cell phone tapes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial food items were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cold fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food orders is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our newest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; you can view more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # College , College and College . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which dedic@@ ates itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers , &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed people regularly appear only in statistics , but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning with drug trade &quot; ) that tells the victims a voice and tell stories of people involved in the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and whole communities therefore need to travel many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who every weekend seeks secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on one single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; just like every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have placed , to go out and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electro@@ shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but it doesn &apos;t pay it out , because they require a mort@@ al certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ?
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ Ã¨s a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership of the state . &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a Les@@ bian from Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter in what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been acquainted with disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I am coming every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover page with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different here or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) if he &apos;s big . and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is as if they under@@ mine those who have lost someone and those who fear that something is happening to them . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic .
&quot; the imp@@ unity of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; open &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to agree that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , when they are not touched and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the Capital district . &quot; as a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats , it describes how an armed criminal month weigh@@ ed money from their business until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain over it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded its report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in those fear@@ ful days , I wondered if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep roots feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
what about growing in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , boil potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm , and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life of violence exists and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home , who saw bloody cor@@ p@@ ses of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government Council for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this equ@@ als 8,5 Mor@@ des per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed war against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶@@ ms ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it is linked , include images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue . &quot;
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ guided to educ@@ ate trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not den@@ ote the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tank wagon crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people killed . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank wagon fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the football World Cup . &quot;
houses cleaned and char@@ tered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to in@@ denti@@ ality .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ tered body lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photograph has been un@@ earth@@ ed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one was left to count bodies , &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been dism@@ ember@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
the following time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was mistakenly shown as evidence of the fact and scale of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
another step further brings personal comments like this example fal@@ sely the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture taken from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee from blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts tagged as the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to depic@@ t this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which called AF@@ P as their source , were also wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein Sein and , however , did not relate to the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings go back to the years of 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; one can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have for@@ warded incorrect reports but some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; we have limited examples of ab@@ usive use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be thoroughly r@@ ins@@ ed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Frames .
examples of false cou@@ pl@@ uses of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to sites or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Myanmar - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ usive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted to del@@ igh@@ ti@@ ze , as the photos of it have been mis@@ used . &quot;

&quot; the Myanmar government issued a provision on what it was intended to be &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with respect to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this recti@@ fication , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors used by H@@ ate Speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

this news site fal@@ sely stated that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein have admitted that monks and politicians have been involved in killing Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .

&quot; this article from 2014 about students killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news site An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;

&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and solved a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were paying a greater attention to these events , which presum@@ ably took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am ( and saved more than 9.@@ 300 times ) but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message supposedly written by an &quot; &quot; Pater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be fal@@ si@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; from the message containing the image from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) also point out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison with a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images in connection with these efforts are used .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images from a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images for@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used detached from the context or entirely impro@@ per way . &quot;
&quot; however , each examination of false write @-@ downs should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog named Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. conf@@ lic@@ ting ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to be translated . &quot;
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portu@@ ges@@ e Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Mus@@ h@@ room your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they un@@ v@@ eils other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of this &quot; &quot; unbe@@ ar@@ able &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly valued by Un@@ translator , are invited to upload their favourite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ds and floo@@ ds in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped up over the shore by heavy rainf@@ all . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement by the earthquake centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missed due to the floo@@ ds and mud @-@ waves . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 jobs . &quot;
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge to the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water bo@@ oth@@ s of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et regularly updates to flood @-@ water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the magnitude of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on its way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stand in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the floo@@ ded water table of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies to the inhabitants who are floo@@ ded in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been willing to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pic@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ ast@@ o centre is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button , allowing users to retrieve a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge . &quot;
&quot; they also led a SO@@ S button , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful rescue operations for flood and land@@ slide . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and afford assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and a dear friend . &quot;
I trust her my four years old daughter ; she trust@@ s her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next step , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their imagination .
they mus@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that once Muslims , as I do not fit in there , will be mis@@ led . &quot;
to be ab@@ duc@@ ed
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you feel when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , just as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting imag@@ ery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images . &quot;
but these images also stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood still keep it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades , while the US could not even choose its first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
&quot; it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which have been brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has so deep and flaw@@ ed our collective imagination that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ viral attacks and toxic@@ ity .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the other . &quot;
1.7 billion belongs to
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America .
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ sham@@ eless American .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants who come from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now free Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of picking up my Muslim recipes or wearing my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I am j@@ esting , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we do not have to be a the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current strip by a well @-@ adorned Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already flaw@@ ed image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is an anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s head cloth . &quot;
&quot; or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ liest forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it acc@@ esses our identity , which is so spacious , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I kept her in my arms , and whis@@ per@@ ing the Arab Ver@@ se to protect the Koran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one that one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to the image of my grandmother with her sisters , how they gain a contest of the art of the flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi holi@@ er ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to speak the prayers , which she told me when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - for centuries - has been col@@ oni@@ alized by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Easter company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my dar@@ ing grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ punished for his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he did not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have dealt with the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first bom@@ b@@ shell of history was cast off over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , K@@ ash@@ mir@@ an underground of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the word of Islam .

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , go deep into our unforgettable family trees , our un@@ restricted history . &quot;
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , scattered across every continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the rub@@ ble of the war .
being an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy hits the US and the suspect has a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube of sor@@ cer@@ ers , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble cle@@ ver@@ ness &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural Islamic hos@@ tility . &quot;
structural Islam hos@@ tility exists in the Muslim Regi@@ str@@ ates that started with President Bush and were wi@@ dened by President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that involves its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which mostly refers Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we run , and the bombs that we cast into Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University presented a scientifically wrong image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to carry
we are too deep to de@@ duce the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints , which we keep in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims inside the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the viral video gallery Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global pun@@ ctu@@ ation in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old , as it was now my daughter , but that made me a Muslim woman today . &quot;
things that I have left in my speech here as a bread@@ crum@@ b .
&quot; things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , a story may be loud when someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , con@@ gresses take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or read them in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were enth@@ r@@ alled through the work of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation four decades ago was himself a scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously k@@ rep@@ j@@ at the &quot; other . &quot; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake was feeding , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ ative Art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; telling stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license . &quot;
can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , is an answer to telling stories in their original language . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project the following applies :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often connected to &quot; understanding , &quot; these events &quot; &quot; listen to , &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to make sense . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story in their own language and translate or interpret it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and representation cause the audience to be inspired . &quot;
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Constance also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ ug@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !

&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 . the march began at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ana . &quot;
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ u@@ dad de la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debt are held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests at the public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding salary , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be deter@@ red with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the US state @-@ based sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be dangerous without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration bore the name &quot; Night@@ wear for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event took place in the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher in the France resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , prints copies from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what are the true cost associated with it . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked on page to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet @-@ volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that would push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away . &quot;
&quot; seeing Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own f@@ ates , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge by an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its place of residence and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , b@@ ass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes were more prec@@ arious than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ breeding of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here it mer@@ ges Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would make everything possible , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this expe@@ ditions into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , b@@ ass@@ el has not yet been able to complete this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life , dream of freedom and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in prison .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read and write English .
b@@ ass@@ el opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically without having actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a journal that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book Cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book by Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I &apos;m going into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes bid f@@ arewell
and I let another piece of my soul be with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el :
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
during the day
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tort@@ ured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : corruption of convic@@ ted director after release again on previous post
&quot; Mozambique responded to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half his sentence of imprisonment to the work place in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from Mozambique airports , whose advice was given to Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to its old post since the company did not undertake disciplinary proceedings following its detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people don &apos;t know the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle judging the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take to note is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
&quot; however , the company apparently held no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; contrary &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half had hed@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ ised !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director doesn &apos;t charge any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because it insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ale and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was pre@@ charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in jail : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , but not only for the first independent president but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of anything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ or@@ ah also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was sitting for 10 years and released . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he spo@@ ils money , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ NI@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î²@@ Î¹@@ Ðº atively ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ or many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der @-@ b@@ se .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network gained their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still deb@@ ated , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; in Burma &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely dimin@@ ishing con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is usually associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about his use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair in Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ e@@ oo@@ Wor@@ ker A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ung is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook needs to be more analy@@ tic before it breaks out all posts that are in suspic@@ ion of racism . &quot;
&quot; Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; not manually . &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ ebo@@ x .
&quot; what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post , check it by checking the words that are next to them . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Cal@@ ar H@@ tine &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; ( spi@@ der legs ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive quite a good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cut its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to er@@ ase his posts when he wanted to share his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
&quot; when I was aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; &quot; the Facebook Community standards did not meet . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who don &apos;t have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to l@@ essen racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have for@@ b@@ ade words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the frau@@ dul@@ ent posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits , which gave them a great deal of turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Dat@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has caused much mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now am@@ using Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which did not contain hate speech but were nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the post , which contains the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally raise the violence in Myanmar &apos;s communities , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure , the prolifer@@ ating hate speeches on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look more in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the Chil@@ d@@ hood is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban the practice , so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ san@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter @-@ Relig@@ ious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere as it does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of UN children &apos;s rights convention , the min@@ ors as , , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements who tried to abol@@ ish laws for child@@ birth , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dar@@ n , take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children of children - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must appro@@ ve and announce the law .
one of the country sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook which posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it , and not a single one against it . &quot;
&quot; after it has been decided in the Senate before , the draft can now become the law . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dressed an minist@@ erial office at the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk , which has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? it &apos;s illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 on the other ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who openly talked about how important the adoption of the law was noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment of the marriage contract was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all dep@@ u@@ ties who were against have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s height is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth counter .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
heart@@ y congratulations .
a thanks to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be able to fulfil his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished , the debate on the subject would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as common , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and arro@@ gan@@ ce , if we , instead of talking about the problem that we , our daughters towards being ab@@ used to them , would then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or continues to be the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many techni@@ c@@ experienced Internet users are used to use change tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking the article by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform still remains locked , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) have appeared . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform stopped all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; despite legal prohibition , the content is available . &quot;
in a blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to cover snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is by Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia side so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation
&quot; a Su@@ det@@ achable N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned motives and washed colours .
they motivated him to carry a camera and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar confron@@ ts Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife on the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first class situation helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when I suddenly called me in Navar@@ ra ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a phone call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my dad watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to bend pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar asp@@ ires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he was standing before face to face with him : &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ zz appeared . he immediately starts to see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;
see some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , it was the first time that Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ mp@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should desp@@ ise the norm , maintain this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and rejected by her family and village community after she had addressed a married kin with her name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also is not common among men . however , they have far less credit to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , entered a unique club , thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them only in which they discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ is has been working with the help of her video camera to detect practices , such as children &apos;s mar@@ riages , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and simultaneously made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion were women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
saying that the name of their hus@@ bands is not to be utter@@ ed lou@@ dly is a custom that they owe to all and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not observe this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she said , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women must never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was just sitting in front of herself , another decided to release all the frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ bing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient br@@ ink , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women into the head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law was star@@ ing her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a student &apos;s husband was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot , if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely listened to it , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who to hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ted cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , morality ent@@ ails with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly getting into play : &quot;
so far we have only done small steps .
some women tried it a few times but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
&quot; some , including me , still make it , but only when they are alone and are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead each time .
&quot; the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as lo@@ osing more freedom of movement , or their own choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us the assurance that something will change .
I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29 of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , in which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is considered a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . after 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese Kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools . &quot;
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les out@@ lived everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if these &quot; Winn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; pupp@@ et John L@@ enn@@ on should represent or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the famous places that are related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , that is your 5 places you must visit absolutely &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( from Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum )
pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went to London for a pilgrimage to London and walked across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fans in the market , such as this R@@ amen store ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day . &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
so the day is going to run today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;
&quot; following the h@@ ash@@ tag of the Vienn@@ ain Association , there is the need to learn more about the Beat@@ les memorial day . &quot;
men &apos;s men are deport@@ ed and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bab@@ y@@ headed men could be target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of crew members for organ traff@@ icking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ let district , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
&quot; according to local super@@ sti@@ tions , that the head of a man @-@ headed man could bring gold or wealth , the spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC explained . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks have been recorded on the bald men in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 mission in South Africa to investigate a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are aiming for ritual attacks , the Mos@@ ambique police ra@@ zed according to the latest assass@@ inations of three men of men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ek , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already been following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are engaged in the death of the men of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of self @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power to recover the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger Armen Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a who suggested that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty that Mozambique faces :
&quot; I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE like to get ONE MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH is ashamed of a country in which people would be ashamed to go to the streets , or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which the men would be ashamed , or even their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim at reaching rapid prosperity . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some left the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably made recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after having announced his attorney at the end of June , that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that promp@@ ted democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he did not consider it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China will continue to accept calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some foreign reactions .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway in Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government agreed that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to immediately liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she said in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
they should meet and receive all the visits that they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in so far as it assi@@ sts him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person on the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia of their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US embassy attracted a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and have ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of their choice , which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Gold@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany : Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns whether the Wir@@ bel around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide a proper medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ P previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release interventions for the exercise of these rights . &quot;

&quot; on 29 June , the French Foreign Ministry called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan in China
&quot; on 27 June , the Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan called on Li@@ u to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature of Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , had led to a more harmon@@ ic , more stable and weal@@ th@@ ier China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem foolish , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io &apos;s blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons given by Shan@@ mu@@ iden were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of that , it seemed to be inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the subject , the good old cor@@ p@@ se emerges from the author@@ itarian cre@@ ators who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system . &quot;
he clo@@ aked up corresponding questions with non @-@ responses ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng requires Shan@@ mu@@ iden to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by posting his comment on the blog , he points out the criticism that one should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the co@@ dex .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore wasn &apos;t a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in that sense ! &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement as the leader of a growing generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes this is true and he is aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review spl@@ its the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign one mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is both land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the cabinet of government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; defending the country , above all , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series of rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series is by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I reply . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication mostly follows the standard response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook in anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; American , on the other hand ... &quot;
&quot; it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ les on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there is no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think that Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is basically to be fun - as well as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; being harmless , means being un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention . &quot;
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open @-@ heart@@ ed kindness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau went on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band , famous in Thailand , released a music video that trans@@ codes Jun@@ ta who seized power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which rules he makes his girlfriend .
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band has been praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was shared 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as well as the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has pursued in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ fted section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; change Your Set@@ ting &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; setting @-@ up &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people seen by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic En@@ am@@ ation ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup by the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continued to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song was showing members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;

&quot; the post @-@ war society is slowly catching up in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ dic@@ ated war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ n@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ ha@@ zia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked for Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the majority of Russians and Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ v@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people living here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cl@@ ergy . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after barely over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 3 ) 3,@@ 8@@ 64 6@@ 19 Happy Bir@@ th@@ day New@@ by ! ! ! &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother for@@ b@@ ade us that we let ourselves be photograp@@ hed , &quot; &quot; said one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A , as mentioned in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;

Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot;

G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , she is reminded of the village life in front of the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply gone away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while running , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide awareness in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , Chi@@ ap@@ as State , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold coloured earrings in Ted@@ dy B@@ ears . &quot;
she is called Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nickname is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 Dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s rather quiet at the moment , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have slept outdoors on board . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medication which they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that drew from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
Foto : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he relates that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
MS Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her that her guests send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she declares that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small home . &quot;
it is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive to sell .
&quot; he began to help them get a decent price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking spot outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after living for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are coming from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a solo traveler , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , the travellers consult quietly their teleph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she flo@@ ats in her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair pla@@ ques that she made an art girl , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she briefly presents her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users , is the &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which the district government in@@ stru@@ cts a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , ebooks and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the min@@ ors for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable government actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mainly focus on users &apos; experiences in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , troubled ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often assign extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from Hot China , &quot; the cens@@ ored news published in China published photos of a check@@ point where police checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification called for people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected in a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Hot China &quot; ( which is true in the German language ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system , thereby ob@@ struc@@ ting un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media cards &quot; at the local police on June 27 in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi &apos;s regional capital . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bark@@ li@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; series , in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you are looking at and realize that you &apos;re all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes all the glory to her name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , beautiful scenes and performers - the characters transform themselves into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts pers@@ ist in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if Earth is on the axis of disaster . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents and before them have built your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the leader of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five you@@ ths were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it was enough for the city to sm@@ ash the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , less rainy , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
in the third night things had a bit cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood .
&quot; I interrupted the silence , scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined us to a splendid picture that filled my expectations completely and completely . &quot;
&quot; at such a moment you realize that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t care for you in the least . &quot;
I received a call from my father : &quot; get ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
and you really mo@@ urn what to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so certain to my thing when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; puts him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father immediately with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , like that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition lies me up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I had been exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the court .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then back through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a passage to the individual cells . &quot;
I pres@@ ume all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have assigned me a bigger cell this time .
I have to share it with one another prisoner and I must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell , and I stepped on an old tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : to strike the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ Mate was a &quot; &quot; hus@@ band@@ age &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle @-@ aged man , who resembles me similarly and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no significant facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that lab@@ ou@@ ze at the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light which presented to us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they are speaking in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their religious black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I supervised the audi@@ torium and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that esc@@ ort him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations , which will soon come to an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have used it to not answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to getting used to it , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
in punishment in all their variety .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably stems from the clo@@ aks .
your head@@ sman will be touched by your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself and you cannot hold your cri@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not yet enough , why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , a great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them changed , while still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ors to it why he attacked an electri@@ cally charged wand .
&quot; flow through my whole body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
my half naked body lay out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Arsch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I am answering with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he locks himself to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; however , what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ i@@ ye@@ witnesses ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can feel himself with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t admit it , he won a special reluc@@ tance to US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; escaped from the second generation - so he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he poured into water Nes@@ cafÃ© into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian legislation also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose speak first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - like drinking water in the public during Ram@@ adan - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jordan &apos;s Ministry of Interior ordered a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual inc@@ it@@ ator Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
the MPs and former press spokes@@ men of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which confron@@ ts the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supp@@ orter of human rights , &quot; who continue to advoc@@ ate for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simple rhetor@@ ic , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear @-@ crystall@@ ising reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b returns traditional sex men to body by making his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly d@@ vi@@ ed unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch right up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women , who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust . &quot;
&quot; in Jordan , the number of &quot; &quot; hon@@ our@@ able kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ our@@ able kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to appropriately support women . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of family violence must be held in prison for in@@ definite time , and their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not do anything . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music is very popular , and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , he adm@@ its that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ usions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was in@@ tru@@ ded to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
in one song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repeatedly repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comment@@ aries were plu@@ cked out of the context and had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who later was to work on behalf of the cali@@ bers , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ards do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression , and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence agency fixed several former members of government and members of the teacher association , with the ration@@ ale that they would have seen critical comments in social media on issues associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jordan River . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has resist@@ ed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - such is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , street uni@@ tions and in artificial ways . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the stron@@ gh@@ olds , drums and dancing have been handed over over a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ z , to its knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , held a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking back to Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two permanent wag@@ ons are to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; outside appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ kers and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and the unusual styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in getting more and more normal people into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts face each other in order to show who of them can create the most exclusive looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current events are available on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair@@ dressing room , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a , of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , inspired by the initiative of Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) that encourage young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa warfare F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the peace treaty was considered as important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; for many years , gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have lived in illegal camps , have been exposed to war rhetor@@ ic and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together to help the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - who are to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as a Inspiration for the Campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write to the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
he talked about sharing his love with people this year who needed the most urgent response .
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I would never have thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to convey the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different emotions you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between , &quot; the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the provincial governor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the gu@@ err@@ illa warfare camp . &quot;
&quot; when I saw one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL shell thro@@ wer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless I addressed him and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I reply . &quot; then suddenly my tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and set me next to the Gren@@ ade laun@@ chers .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new votes
&quot; as a pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some of the F@@ ARC members came together to join a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as already a war , and the F@@ ARC already ag@@ itated in hiding . &quot;
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making society more just in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful emotions , who have been turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful to me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me , that all men , including those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were persu@@ aded that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
&quot; so long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to attack and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now sit on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which hangs over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , has not only been created overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q judicial system in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published to address the ab@@ duction , torture and killing of que@@ ens men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested que@@ er que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
she moved out of fear for her life in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just taking a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you repro@@ ach ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
&quot; OC Media : in which case , were you laid - in those of the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me -- relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they put absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going through the streets above . others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that all was only bad speech , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , which has not only sham@@ ef@@ aced your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later I stood under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 .
after it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends reviewed the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to award their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without registering , without proof , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plug@@ ged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to invo@@ ke my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in safety , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , that is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I still carry in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really give effort to look at the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed at home ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that no people were arrested and tort@@ ured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there are not so many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to present themselves Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are captured there so that they can present them as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but sub@@ merged in a targeted way , in order to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says many people have gone missing in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , until now they have not been introduced as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 , I was already known all over the world , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; Zivil@@ isierung &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation &quot; &quot; ) , but in the end we were thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Security Department of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me just one hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , if they make fun of the sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so , just shut their eyes closed before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never ch@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long was this time of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality in television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could sense how people began to change in the city .
&quot; who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I returned home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily worse . &quot;
OC Media : what action do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ps , gather@@ ings , I join them to the hospital and help them get food tickets . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I was par@@ ting refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
&quot; so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who wish to prophes@@ y with foam before the mouth that there are no bo@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what , the cab@@ ard@@ ins have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear anything like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fa@@ sten during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think in transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation , to be precise , different attitudes . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I am sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the ar@@ ming Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian A@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; for the past few months , there has been a sharp rise in su@@ ici@@ des . &quot;
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 res@@ orted the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ign@@ ited herself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ eg@@ gi hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab u@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the ground warned that even more men could take their lives . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all the family F@@ athers , who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy took power and attempted in 1925 to end eth@@ ni@@ cal autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi young people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co @-@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % have finished secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ es and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process .
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at crus@@ hing the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , and to be disgu@@ ised as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activists are forced to alert before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ist
detail of a photo . taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - do with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * in general .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money despite equal education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling earlier or later , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless , if I come to speak on skin color , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ist femin@@ ists decide to be silent . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to persu@@ ade that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ational violence that we are exposed to black women in a two @-@ fold way . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men each have no skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider ine@@ qualities in her mind , which refers to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also ref@@ ra@@ ined to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized entity in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and del@@ ine@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which has been established as a woman for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we can define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book African wom@@ ans : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by creating spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitutes the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement by which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine devoted to international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled regularly over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special focus on Kurdist@@ an in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country feared that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Alliance - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who uses and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed and released for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on dis@@ continued , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative Vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed municipalities can tell their stories their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women are &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; to express their pain over the women &apos;s kill@@ ings in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ lt ) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected individuals .
&quot; a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as a further Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out because of ill @-@ treatment , the meticul@@ ous ad of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was also useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make a display at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 beats and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system , which is nothing sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence at the County Prosecutor &apos;s Office . 70 % of them were committed to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads on the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads on domestic violence in peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here too . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for mental ill @-@ treatment , 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; on every woman ref@@ unded due to physical abuse , there are two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay , a woman died due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that , she still gave up . this should rep@@ ent her forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psychological force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ missive , because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , telling them how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen out of Carlos for so long and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything began with psych@@ ic abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an in@@ comprehen@@ sible legal battle between Paraguay and her homeland , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ees is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ residents ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ dom@@ ic@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and to pun@@ ish har@@ dier , as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; the legislative text has been modified in some points in order to win the MEPs for the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently banned in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had planned , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which must bear the victims of violence at present , if they simply ref@@ rain from displaying adver@@ ts and to obtain a secure accommodation , to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for this :
in Paraguay no ill @-@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as something normal . &quot;
&quot; whoever is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the off@@ ence of the offen@@ ders . &quot;
we have to refund as long as abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate was adopted . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the administration of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the prohibited newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison where he served as a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were arrested and tried , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had put down his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of Sul@@ t@@ ans is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially inland sec@@ rec@@ y , the public civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , to torture and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the paper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to the freedom of the press in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , captured an article entitled &quot; High @-@ Ranking Members of Justice &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance law@@ suit . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS taken the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information issued the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the paper in any way , including online , was prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ k@@ at . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; both Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , for disturb@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violations of the ban and slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for dissemin@@ ating material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anian ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court pronounced Al @-@ Ha@@ j on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the court &apos;s decision to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Korean government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s continued closure and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman .
&quot; further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ as and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the long closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ri@@ ment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities to : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the paper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ imp@@ eded their legitimate human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial chic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather together peac@@ efully and provides them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on @-@ site : firstly there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have much more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the study of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am currently investigating a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions which have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being makers themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or get here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards developed in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big in your opinion is the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , beginning at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious illnesses ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the more difficult access to scientific expertise , which pose challenges here . &quot;
the system that magazines can only be made available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 types , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many types of salad he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more let@@ tu@@ ce were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
&quot; patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia of old tradition Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but he needs longer , since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der to whom I must triumph .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think those patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new sort of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the tra@@ its are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it has also joined a movement growing in the US and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeders ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ let@@ at of the sort Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested to be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , shortly called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit to the fact that other seeds bred by them can be freely used . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; gro@@ wers only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties , and it is not immediately dispens@@ ed - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the accredited professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , check on seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed , according to him , plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and thereby anticip@@ ates the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples include the mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples include the mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples include the mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as it is , for example , on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened . &quot;
food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus more and more limited available , shr@@ inks continuously . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are not such estimates yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass grown plants such as wheat are still more patented than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are grown so that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves to such because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; ad@@ vers@@ aries of plant properties point out that the available plant material for gro@@ wers is decreasing due to more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the belief that intellectual property encourages other breeders to promote innovation as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innov@@ ate . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such protection does not im@@ pe@@ de innovation ; it promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public .
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not encourage innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers work easier .
it is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources .
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form them and as breeders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass @-@ wise her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is contrary to the contrary . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the experim@@ enting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeding bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , because I know that my ri@@ vals will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years against competition , which makes it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a form@@ less and legally binding form of O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bree@@ der in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( provisions for breeding differ from country to country , why the O@@ SS@@ I commitment cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to apply the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official launch . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group for erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - has published a report . in this , it represents the view that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , to exchange it and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon recognise him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a part , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

all winners received certificates as a reminder and other prizes such as souven@@ irs with the competition logo or vou@@ chers for online shops .
&quot; the authors of the 11 photos with the highest jury evalu@@ ations , as well as cont@@ est@@ ants who were able to collect most of the objects and collect the most points in the total score , were honored with prizes . &quot;
other awards were awarded by other organizations who joined the competition .
&quot; for example , the employees of the conservation park Hol@@ o@@ iv@@ sky@@ i , located in the Metropolitan Region of Kiev , have selected the three best photos taken in bes@@ agu@@ ered park and submitted to the competition . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there were also some special categories in the national competition : &quot; &quot; Un@@ pleasant Discovery &quot; , &quot; which documents the destruction of natural habitats , initiated by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of themes , while photos on Wikipedia were missing best wildlife photos and best Kiev photo &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of May 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network made a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law , it was never as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after blocking the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network due to alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web side blocks to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic : https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer exists in Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada made use of his blog for spreading colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog that he set up to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , who is home to Canada &apos;s blog , on the other hand , is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video about how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , when blocking the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege @-@ state ; an arrest , a temp@@ ting murder , summ@@ ons at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; in other words , my words have influence , although only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have locked it and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave ones go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; besides , af@@ te also documented the locking of providers , possible through the circum@@ ference of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called virtual private networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) . &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how to block web pages that V@@ PN@@ s started . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian people have no legal basis , with which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .
&quot; the Brazilian army deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;
&quot; photo by : Est@@ ado Mai@@ or ( C@@ ML ) via photos p@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ as , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; newspapers all over Brazil report glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves smoking chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a stra@@ ined financial situation , the 2017 threshold of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra , &quot; known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper as follows :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything , however , passes from civili@@ zed standard and what is only happening in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the editorial the newspaper writes further :
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; har@@ den more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira claims that violence is called &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is &quot; the most violent city in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the State of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ as per federal state , Rio is at No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; Glob@@ o belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , that , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia empha@@ sizes , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for many years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit raised by the State of Rio in 2003 , aiming to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police bill and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio is also causing serious consequences for human beings . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to deplo@@ y means and ways that are typical of a war . to this end , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ clear point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
a week ago the police came up with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : revi@@ ved Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sieg@@ es and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime loyal to loy@@ alist troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under si@@ ege from Damascus , causing residents to be transported locally or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics con@@ stru@@ cts the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria and are only very rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , they make them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , spoke to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge for the planting of fung@@ i , says Dr. Lei@@ la on Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to raise funds on cand@@ o until Monday , September 04 , 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally manufactured fuel is used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger bath . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom culture for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break the si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ due ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to collect new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested in many suburbs in Portugal on October 21 , demanding justice for the victims of the fires , which were in the north of Portugal last week . &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the last week of solidarity with the victims was proclaimed a state of state .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia area in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks spread in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017 alone , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of gravity : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a is ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and anti @-@ fire measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not capable of comb@@ ating the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers from Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the shape of the wood , which the government had brought in to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val carries out in the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environment organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees consist of easily combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , still spreading to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers did not survive the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persec@@ uted the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

in one night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban .
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; at dawn , the boy was supposed to break . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ bollah faction , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ fail@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a coal mine for a few years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we were not freezing at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ qi has left behind his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum request , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago , A@@ shar@@ k was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; true , Italy is a second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high prob@@ ation rates . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have filed an application for asylum - which can take months after the application of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ k .
&quot; but his un@@ restra@@ ined way of life helped A@@ shar@@ k , soon to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after he had done various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film won the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant ori@@ ent experience in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the history of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic trade and retail and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where risk is , there are also opportunities , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k says with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k also for@@ ge plans for the opening of a Kab@@ ul factory in which people can learn packaging and preser@@ vatives techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stands stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along the way . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : bills from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos; a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot of the challenges , victories , and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews the draft bill , which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website indicating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the enti@@ t@@ lement of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliamentary members , is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the parliament submitted a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced to ins@@ ult the president or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the law , such action would be punished with pris@@ ons and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Hiz@@ b Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograp@@ hed Egyptian police , who demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the office of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like more than 700 people who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in jail for a court hearing . &quot;
&quot; recently his trial was postpon@@ ed until 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , false charges , including weapons of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and corruption . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza gave free speech to two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the punishment of journalists &apos; Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
inter@@ rog@@ ated Tunis@@ ian milit@@ ants on le@@ av@@ ened documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with inter@@ rog@@ ating Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been inter@@ rog@@ ated primarily with a le@@ av@@ ened action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , would ensure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all illeg@@ ally received funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans are to support the legislation . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the attri@@ bution of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their ID ?
&quot; according to the new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
the regulations also indicate that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that this elimin@@ ates the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is un@@ clear to now how authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; Organ@@ izer of Information Dis@@ semination . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a stat@@ ute of the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the Government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ gor@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed the wi@@ dening Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication , had been blocked because it was &quot; &quot; an information source working together with groups to address a political Diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation on increased surveillance capabilities that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and to install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted tel@@ cos and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has out@@ sour@@ ced other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ war@@ dly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the consultation is still ongoing until the 19th of May . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
