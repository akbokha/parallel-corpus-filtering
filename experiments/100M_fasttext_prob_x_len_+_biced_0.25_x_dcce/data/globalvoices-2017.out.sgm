<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time now."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican's letter, a fearless reporter who supported the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts as a law student."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was like it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one who you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps his mind behind the mountain as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in multitudes for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party has ever reached."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps's worldview was not in line with the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer, Peter Bhatia."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles for life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits with the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump turned his way to the nominees Republican presidential candidate they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump voters than Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom know, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those looking differently from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(note of the whites against all other ethnicities"; pun from white in reference to whites and whiplash, which means sling trauma), as the great Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America did so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America that promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan asked."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"if Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "laughed the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried, and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, it is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca co-operate with the children of the Paraguaean city of Catalya?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular with tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now La banda de m√∫sica (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot, who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you will always be laughing and playing with shiny eyes and playing in the turbel you will learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, maple, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero the children of Catalya - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunci√≥n in Paraguay's capital - are based on instruments made from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments, which consist of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Ch√°vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all made out of trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio Ch√°vez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Catalya, remember the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in trash. the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed when Favio was shown something, which he had never seen before: a violin produced out of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an orchestra which plays instruments from reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic M√ºlldeponie) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about a billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication will take place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia, before it opened the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law-breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to run one of their harbors and refused to give it a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which outlines criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 founded by the NGO stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network were the six countries that had driven Premier out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are interconnected and work together. they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species should be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i watches the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those who suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of Nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the previously mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost sales, which lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen entering east African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. under these also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of fantasies, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately explode the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could then say" "You can't run my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" "Come to me". "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 research of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conceal their activities and position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, whereby they can no longer be located by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system connecting different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal agulating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Maritime Organization of Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project to run in which a global system permits tracking of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously had been fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa every year several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the aim of even more such initiatives and structures is to be made in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to report its first great triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used towing nets that are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also steeped in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "using measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"this is another success for FISH-i. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate as a result of a acute lack of food and medicines in the everyday life of the Venezuelans.</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the office of the current president Nicol√°s Maduro, but in the end the attitude of a new election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne D√≠az, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% of the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to reconquer its institutional structures and close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the Following Day as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government seat, the Venezuelan government seat, planned on 3 November, should continue to be suspended."</seg>

<seg id="201">"in the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated, which were committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">"for 34 years, he kept family secrecy for himself."</seg>

<seg id="235">This day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were parked and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I stepped in and saw a lying on which people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a waterbed and a metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied there.</seg>

<seg id="267">The 'war spoils'</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal all things in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered: and you, who stole cars on the road?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>

<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he nevertheless brought clothes to home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense was accused of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me on the burden of what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="300">It would have been possible to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but what's their corpses to disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families to whom one could pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last disgusting act that one can do to a person.</seg>

<seg id="307">I saw how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clarify it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I simply said the truth about twenty criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought to display my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him reproach for all the atrocities I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly dismissed and asked me why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they supposedly defended, were actually good."</seg>

<seg id="350">"edited by Joshua Levine, which was often shared in social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was made to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-appearing newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation)," "said the police."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, who can produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still make translations into company-internal. then, the Japanese collaborator, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made for translators, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the proverbial and mysterious propositions which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique can't replace any human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, Kyoto takes advantage of a more serious source of translation."</seg>

<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers.</seg>

<seg id="500">"Pixabay image, modified by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Public Domain CC0 is published.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently voted on a draft law on "the regulations regarding the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt by a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established, which is commissioned to give citizens a permit to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, it could be a punishment of up to six months in jail or a fine."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill consisting of six paragraphs and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application, which runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft has no indication on how Egyptian authorities want to impose the registration on users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall, which blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But so far it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" senior researcher ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that, as they violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means they will be set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court case."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees, before proceeding into the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is consistent with a pro-military thought in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensuring that no deviating narration is present on the screen," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring Prefectures Fukushima and Iwate have been evacuated because the tsunami had lost whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, alone, alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing Construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, altogether 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (in the Raigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, six years after the disaster, evacuated by Behelfssigned shipyards (which is the case, Kazetsu juutaku) is trying to relocate into final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple calamity, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>

<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated who hauled after the disaster were resettled in final houses."</seg>

<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>

<seg id="563">Tsunami and the nuclear accident killed in the three prefectures agriculturally.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear proliferation zone. ""</seg>

<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent spare-houses."</seg>

<seg id="581">"most of the evacuated ones who still dwell in shelters are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after succumbing, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they were hardly competitive for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target amounted to 4 million tonnes."</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use hip-hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this via hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshops are launching mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in Montreal and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop thereby increases that the young participants talk about topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-cycle dance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the US state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"for example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribal of the Kitswkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a street section in western kanada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">"for the most part, the cases were not solved."</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalization."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths are not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoosti Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the youths involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstar Hip-Hop band, who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in translation, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody will ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth.</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth.</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what the Creator has appointed</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plastic models of the dishes" ") of every dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers view these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even attract them. however, a new trend is turning today into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"in Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic panties decorated cell phone tapes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial food items were transformed into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin cold fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food orders is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter." ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you can view more skurrile plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # College, College and College."</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which dedicates itself to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made.</seg>
<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"for the victims of the fight against drug traffickers,"</seg>
<seg id="747">Photo by Flickr user Mart√≠n Garc√≠a.</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" struggle against drug trafficking "in Mexico, the missing and killed people regularly appear only in statistics, but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzm√°n, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every corpse, behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol√≠tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learning with drug trade") that tells the victims a voice and tell stories of people involved in the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Pol√≠tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and whole communities therefore need to travel many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father, who every weekend seeks secret tombs after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodr√≠guez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on one single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "just like every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have placed, to go out and search for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electroshop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta said: "it's very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but it doesn't pay it out, because they require a mortal certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that?</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Apr√®s a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a Lesbian from Animal Pol√≠tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter in what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I am coming every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover page with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent here or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he's big. and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the" "heroic" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is as if they undermine those who have lost someone and those who fear that something is happening to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the impunity of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "open". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to agree that they remain spared by such tragedies, when they are not touched and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months of blackmail in the Capital district. "as a family has been plundered with threats, it describes how an armed criminal month weighed money from their business until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain over it never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded its report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in those fearful days, I wondered if weeping would dissolve my deep roots feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Guti√©rrez Vega released the article" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Ju√°rez: a Generation of Violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">What about growing in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, boil potatoes, tortillas warm, and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life of violence exists and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier than he was just a few blocks away from his home, who saw bloody corpses of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in Ju√°rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju√°rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Ju√°rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government Council for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office was 3103 Morde. this equals 8,5 Mordes per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Pol√≠tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed war against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rumor or to expose a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misguided to educate tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">This false pairing of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not denote the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria. "</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010 a tank wagon crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. there were 230 people killed."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country was neglected and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses cleaned and chartered corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to indentiality.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" "This is Nigeria". "from Imgur User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the gruesome scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of chartered body lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photograph has been unearthed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpses lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one was left to count bodies," "said a Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many have been dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">The following time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was mistakenly shown as evidence of the fact and scale of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further brings personal comments like this example falsely the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture taken from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning message, published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee from blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts tagged as the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news site, which in 2012 falsely claimed that President Myanmars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to depict this information."</seg>
<seg id="857">"the original contribution, which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here."</seg>
<seg id="858">"other news organizations, which called AFP as their source, were also wrongly attributed to Thein Sein and, however, did not relate to the image of the DR Congo."</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide reach of false information</seg>

<seg id="862">"an inverted image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion images (as of 3 May 2017), which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo."</seg>
<seg id="863">"they come from a mixture of private pages, platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese."</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have forwarded incorrect reports but some have tried to expose the forgeries.</seg>
<seg id="865">"we have limited examples of abusive use and associated them with the respective countries, on the basis of which page they have been published. thus, we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the murder of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison with a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images in connection with these efforts are used.</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue, and the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images from a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images forensitize readers and viewers and have the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used detached from the context or entirely improper way."</seg>

<seg id="1131">"why am I telling this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people were enthralled through the work of the" "other" "in the public presentation four decades ago was himself a scientist of Stanford."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it, consciously and unconsciously krepjat the" other. "just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the employment that we have no president, the chocolate cake was feeding, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion."</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for Narrative Art wants to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">"telling stories, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license."</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, is an answer to telling stories in their original language."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces, in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often connected to" understanding, "these events" "listen to," "to appreciate, to make sense."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers introduce their story in their own language and translate or interpret it in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation cause the audience to be inspired."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Constance also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyugara tells the tale of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamamusara is asked:" how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend it. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytelling."</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for remoralization of public debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-check of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organisations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017. the march began at the Puertoria Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Col√≥n in the old town of San Juana."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was called by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditor√≠a de la Deuda" (Ciudad de la Auditor√≠a de la Deuda) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for the debt are held responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests at the public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding salary, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be deterred with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the US state-based sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Center for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed on the outside will be dangerous without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration bore the name "Nightwear for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">"the Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year."</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">"more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"at this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event took place in the # FreeBel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"M√©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher in the France resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara R√ºhling, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', prints copies from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge, and what are the true cost associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked on page to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet-volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra Prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled" "Collective Remembrance" "gives his friends and his family a voice that would push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own fates, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge by an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of residence and condition remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes were more precarious than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossbreeding of numerous civilizations and here it merges Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would make everything possible, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expeditions into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, bassel has not yet been able to complete this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life, dream of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read and write English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners as they use computers, at least theoretically without having actually held one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a journal that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book by Nora titled "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">"it happens at every visit,"</seg>
<seg id="1229">"that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,"</seg>
<seg id="1230">"that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that I don't care about any of the dangers,"</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and guards"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisons of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I'm going into every detail of your voice and words</seg>

<seg id="1239">"to bring back all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to weep and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I convince myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">Ghazi wrote on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel:</seg>
<seg id="1243">"a year passes, my soul"</seg>

<seg id="1248">"since the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"by 2016, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison since 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: corruption of convicted director after release again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambique responded to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half his sentence of imprisonment to the work place in the state apparatus, where corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose advice was given to Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-setting to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic who evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to its old post since the company did not undertake disciplinary proceedings following its detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people don't know the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade P√∫blica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle judging the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take to note is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently held no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Eg√≠dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" contrary ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half had hedged."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disguised!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director doesn't charge any morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because it insulted him, I cannot believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing the morale and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was precharged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Ze√∫te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in jail:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, but not only for the first independent president but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral depictions was when he vigorously affirmed that" an ambitious man was capable of anything, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samorah also said," I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal at the same time. "</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spider-bse.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network gained their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still debated, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "in Burma" "as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely diminishing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today," Kalar "is usually associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about his use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair in Burmese also wrote 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The FaceooWorker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "Healing" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hung is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radically nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook needs to be more analytic before it breaks out all posts that are in suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Facebook deletes the word" "Kalar" "not manually."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebox.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post, check it by checking the words that are next to them."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Calar Htine" "and" "Kalar pae" "(spider legs)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cut its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone, spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to erase his posts when he wanted to share his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail" "the Facebook Community standards did not meet."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who don't have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intent to lessen racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbade words like" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fraudulent posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits, which gave them a great deal of turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Datebooks automatic censorship has caused much mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now amusing Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which did not contain hate speech but were nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"just to try out whether Facebook is the post, which contains the word" "Kalar". ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post states" If you are a doctor, do you heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"in the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally raise the violence in Myanmar's communities, especially in the Rakhine region, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook was criticized for his failure, the proliferating hate speeches on his Burmese pages under control."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look more in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a Sudetachable Nashorn, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">They motivated him to carry a camera and try to engrave the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar confronts Nepalese wildlife on the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called me in Navarra (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a phone call from my father that would be a leopard on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My dad watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was and I immediately began to bend pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aspires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he was standing before face to face with him:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Buzz appeared. he immediately starts to see us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalympa and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid the utmost care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even of older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should despise the norm, maintain this practice in life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Odisha by a fake court and rejected by her family and village community after she had addressed a married kin with her name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also is not common among men. however, they have far less credit to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, entered a unique club, thus quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them only in which they discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pais has been working with the help of her video camera to detect practices, such as children's marriages, to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and simultaneously made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion were women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Saying that the name of their husbands is not to be uttered loudly is a custom that they owe to all and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not observe this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate. "some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she said," If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean that they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," "says Rohini Paola from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women must never speak the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was just sitting in front of herself, another decided to release all the frustrated frustration of him and his family by curbing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient brink, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women into the head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law was staring her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A student's husband was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred dot, if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely listened to it, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip with each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who to hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a salted curta, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morality entails with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly getting into play:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but then stopped telling the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, still make it, but only when they are alone and are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead each time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as loosing more freedom of movement, or their own choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the assurance that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news of those who experience it, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development claims."</seg>

<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after having announced his attorney at the end of June, that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" "Subversion" "following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that prompted democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the State Department in China referred to Lius case as" an internal affair, "and told a spokesman, he did not consider it as" not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country. "</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China will continue to accept calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or permit him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some foreign reactions.</seg>

<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>

<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister B√∏rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government agreed that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations continued until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"because of his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to immediately liberate Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu as she said in an explanation on 30 June:"</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokesperson on the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message agency AFP announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia of their house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the call of the US embassy attracted a furious answer from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that" "no country has the right to interfere and have irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of their choice, which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Goldley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem foolish, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, with most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">Cavalierio's blog accused the Minister of Justice to "turn logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons given by Shanmuiden were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries "in the face of that, it seemed to be inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the subject, the good old corpse emerges from the authoritarian creators who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He cloaked up corresponding questions with non-responses rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requires Shanmuiden to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by posting his comment on the blog, he points out the criticism that one should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the codex.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore wasn't a country," he obviously did not mean it in that sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam which makes such a polemical statement as the leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes this is true and he is aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review splits the weak points of Shanmugam's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "benign one mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the cabinet of government, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" defending the country, above all, "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry, I reply." I'm from Canada. "since 1994 I live and back in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutors by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification mostly follows the standard response:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature. "many Canadians probably cook in anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">"American, on the other hand..."</seg>
<seg id="1750">"it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried little maples on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, being called" "nice" "is basically to be fun - as well as the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(which has an own Canadian Doppelg√§nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">"being harmless, means being unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention."</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major part of the Canadian."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continued to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold coloured earrings in Teddy Bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 Dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ram√≠rez, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"it's rather quiet at the moment, but this year Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have slept outdoors on board."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medication which they can't pay, they massage them with a balm that drew from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Yoghurtbart) posing with Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Foto: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel it suits her, since African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He relates that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp by Ms Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms Ram√≠rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "he answers smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">MS Ram√≠rez tells her that her guests send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ram√≠rez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes√∫s Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small home."</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive to sell.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them get a decent price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking spot outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after living for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula are coming from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a solo traveler, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travellers consult quietly their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ram√≠rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she floats in her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair plaques that she made an art girl, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeated every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users, is the"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which the district government instructs a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable government actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports about digital censorship in China mainly focus on users' experiences in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, troubled ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to circumvent unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often assign extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet abstentions."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter-based media outlet" Images from Hot China, "the censored news published in China published photos of a checkpoint where police checked the residents indiscriminately, whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification called for people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected in a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Hot China" (which is true in the German language), also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system, thereby obstructing unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang will become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media cards "at the local police on June 27 in a district of Urumqi's regional capital."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" "terrorist videos". "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth, which is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all the glory to her name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting, beautiful scenes and performers - the characters transform themselves into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts persist in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if Earth is on the axis of disaster. you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents and before them have built your grandparents, stone for stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to" learn my lesson, "as the leader of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five youths were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">"it was enough for the city to smash the darkness of the night with" "Allahu Akbar" "screams."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all quarters were coveted, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, less rainy, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that is stuffed up into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night things had a bit calmed down after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I interrupted the silence, screaming several times" "Allahu Akbar" "from my roof."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice disgusted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, real friends joined me; we joined us to a splendid picture that filled my expectations completely and completely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"at such a moment you realize that you release the spirit from the lamp, but it just doesn't care for you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "get ready to meet us at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you screamed it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Upper Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Upper Ghassan starts to speak:" let me also hear how you write "Allahu Akbar," or you are brave enough to scream if we are not close. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes focused on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you really mourn what to look into my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my folly, vanity, perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so certain to my thing when I replied: "I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I've never stopped to look into your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I do not regret a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2032">I went through the court.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then back through the yard and into the second office, which leads through a passage to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I presume all the details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they have assigned me a bigger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with one another prisoner and I must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the officer left the cell, and I stepped on an old tried-and-tested method of communication: to strike the fist against the wall."</seg>

<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no significant facial features can be seen on me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine?</seg>

<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was revealed: to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent us from exposing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they are speaking in the alawitic dialect - so they played their religious blackmail and betrayed the narrow viewpoint of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, this is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I supervised the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he begins a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that escort him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations, which will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have used it to not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"any voice in me said that I had to get used to getting used to it, even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">In punishment in all their variety.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>

<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself and you cannot hold your cries back."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams were not yet enough, why they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables to present us, from their point of view, a great invention of a giant cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour three of them changed, while still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>

<seg id="2076">"flow through my whole body, enough to supply my whole district."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half naked body lay out on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>

<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to lay down again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which happened to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I am answering with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my father must be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and keep you, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they always kept me free.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he locks himself to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"however, what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine stained lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaib's family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as feliyewitnesses (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and he can feel himself with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he doesn't admit it, he won a special reluctance to US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has something to do with his identity as" Palestinian "escaped from the second generation - so he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own circumstances," "Hdaib emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man," "while he poured into water Nescaf√© into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian legislation also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose speak first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - like drinking water in the public during Ramadan - not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordan's Ministry of Interior ordered a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual incitator Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MPs and former press spokesmen of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which confronts the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "who continue to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simple rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear-crystallising reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returns traditional sex men to body by making his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a clearly dvied unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch right up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women, who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in Jordan, the number of" "honourable killings" "has increased in Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honourable killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to appropriately support women."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of family violence must be held in prison for indefinite time, and their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaib's music is very popular, and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, he admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was intruded to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In one song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeatedly repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words," get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember that his commentaries were plucked out of the context and had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudie, who later was to work on behalf of the calibers, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordaniards do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression, and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence agency fixed several former members of government and members of the teacher association, with the rationale that they would have seen critical comments in social media on issues associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordan River."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has resisted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - such is Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, street unitions and in artificial ways. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the strongholds, drums and dancing have been handed over over a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan marched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emisz, to its knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, held a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking back to Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two permanent wagons are to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend its summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and the unusual styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has resulted in getting more and more normal people into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there, experts face each other in order to show who of them can create the most exclusive looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current events are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hairdressing room, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel expelled to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely the question of the young Colombian activists, Leonardo P√°rraga, of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation, inspired by the initiative of Cartas por la reconciliaci√≥n (letters to reconciliation) that encourage young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla warfare FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the peace treaty was considered as important that the Colombian President Jos√© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"for many years, guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps, have been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as a Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write to the people we love, on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">He talked about sharing his love with people this year who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never have thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to convey the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it's incredible how many different emotions you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between," the political science student Manuela Jim√©nez Avila told later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the provincial governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the guerrilla warfare camp."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL shell thrower, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"nevertheless I addressed him and asked," "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "he answered," "I reply to a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I reply." then suddenly my tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and set me next to the Grenade launchers.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes</seg>
<seg id="2221">"as a prelude, students and some of the FARC members came together to join a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as already a war, and the FARC already agitated in hiding."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making society more just in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful emotions, who have been turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful to me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me, that all men, including those who have killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were persuaded that after disarming peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"so long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to attack and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now sit on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2245">"but the threat, which hangs over the LGBTQ community over the LGBTQ community, has not only been created overnight."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ judicial system in Chechnya has conquered international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published to address the abduction, torture and killing of queens men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested queer queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced by the sex equation of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear for her life in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just taking a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you reproach?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I just know that it was a young man, not thirty years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which case, were you laid - in those of the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me -- relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they put absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by going through the streets above. others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that all was only bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world, which has not only shamefaced your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later I stood under the window a car with darkened windows and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends reviewed the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to award their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering, without proof, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to invoke my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think you're in safety, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, that is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really give effort to look at the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed at home?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there are not so many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to present themselves Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are captured there so that they can present them as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanished, but submerged in a targeted way, in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I quote someone who was imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they have not been introduced as bandits, there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to so-called" "non-traditional" "orientation have already taken place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003, I was already known all over the world, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to introduce us to the" "Zivilisierung" "(" "Civilization" "), but in the end we were thrown back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of Sharia has never hurt me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't worry about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, if they make fun of the sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so, just shut their eyes closed before you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never chased and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long was this time of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had laughed and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I returned home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreps, gatherings, I join them to the hospital and help them get food tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I was parting refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature is, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who wish to prophesy with foam before the mouth that there are no boils with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have what, the cabardins have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there is it - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear anything like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasten during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think in transitions to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation, to be precise, different attitudes."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I am sorry that I'm going to be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the arming Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Awaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"for the past few months, there has been a sharp rise in suicides."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 resorted the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ignited herself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleggi hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab uazi minority, and activists on the ground warned that even more men could take their lives."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all the family Fathers, who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and attempted in 1925 to end ethnical autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets only little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi young people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for co-operatives, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% have finished secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Peres and an anti-Arab discrimination in the adjustment process.</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at crushing the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi, and to be disguised as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists are forced to alert before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated.</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I don't identify with feminism even with the intersectionist</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on Afrof√©minas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - do with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money despite equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling earlier or later, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless, if I come to speak on skin color, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectionist feminists decide to be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and" "Kumbaya, my lord" "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to persuade that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist motivational violence that we are exposed to black women in a two-fold way."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men each have no skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider inequalities in her mind, which refers to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in 1851 in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refrained to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized entity in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and delineate themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "still lies in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the Movement of Womanism, which has been established as a woman for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we can define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book African womans: reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by creating spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitutes the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement by which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddle against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine devoted to international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa travelled regularly over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special focus on Kurdistan in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," "Musa tells."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country feared that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeepers Alliance - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who uses and works to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no more water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed and released for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film in Erbil, Iraq, and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is on discontinued, little noticed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative Videography and new multimedia techniques, with whose help suppressed municipalities can tell their stories their way."</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguays women and their difficult fight against violence</seg>
<seg id="2478">"a group of women are" "crying women" "to express their pain over the women's killings in the country and in the region and show their rejection."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefrault) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner told Ada B√°ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as a further Mrs. Balbuena pointed out because of ill-treatment, the meticulous ad of Ada B√°ez was also useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make a display at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 beats and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system, which is nothing subnimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, there were 9600 ads for domestic violence at the County Prosecutor's Office. 70% of them were committed to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads on the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads on domestic violence in peace courts. 86% of women's ads came here too."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for mental ill-treatment, 9 women who do not do so."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman refunded due to physical abuse, there are two women who do not do so," "she stated at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay, a woman died due to violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign with the inscription:" "without complicity, no punishment. # non-emptor" "photo by Jessie Insfran P√©rez. use with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Br√≠tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but after that, she still gave up. this should repent her forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she carried the psychological force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, telling them how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen out of Carlos for so long and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on-site: firstly there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the study of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the sambish health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambische national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am currently investigating a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions which have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being makers themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or get here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards developed in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big in your opinion is the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, beginning at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious illnesses) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the more difficult access to scientific expertise, which pose challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only be made available against payment (the so-called "paywall") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 types, such as Outreddish, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many types of salad he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more lettuce were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or ruffled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as grain or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition Morton still breeds salad, but he needs longer, since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if in a river there is a boulder to whom I must triumph.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think those patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new sort of lettuce because all the traits are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement growing in the US and around the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red R√∂merletat of the sort Outreddish in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested to be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed) is inspired by the free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, shortly called OSSI, US breeders can commit to the fact that other seeds bred by them can be freely used."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "growers only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties, and it is not immediately dispensed - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the accredited professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, check on seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed, according to him, plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, "he says, and thereby anticipates the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples include the mergers in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples include the mergers in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples include the mergers in the global agriculture industry, as it is, for example, on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">Members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to keep their seeds available free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus more and more limited available, shrinks continuously."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are not such estimates yet, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass grown plants such as wheat are still more patented than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves to such because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"adversaries of plant properties point out that the available plant material for growers is decreasing due to more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto acknowledges Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the belief that intellectual property encourages other breeders to promote innovation as" patents and the protection of plant varieties innovate. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not impede innovation; it promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public.</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly does not encourage innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">It is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them and as breeders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass-wise herbicides are needed, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is contrary to the contrary. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the experimenting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, because I know that my rivals will sell my grades in a few years," he says. "with a patent it is protected for 20 years against competition, which makes it easy for my opinion." worldwide resonance "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an" open source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formless and legally binding form of OSSI commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(provisions for breeding differ from country to country, why the OSSI commitment cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now in the governments of the Member States to apply the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for" Open Source "seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official launch."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group for erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - has published a report. in this, it represents the view that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, to exchange it and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon recognise him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a part," said Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of May 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network made a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"in spite of this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law, it was never as important as now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after blocking the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-language issue of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network due to alleged" support for terrorism. ""</seg>

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer exists in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada made use of his blog for spreading columnists and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog that he set up to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, who is home to Canada's blog, on the other hand, is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video about how police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"however, when blocking the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to give me the feeling of a siege-state; an arrest, a tempting murder, summons at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"in other words, my words have influence, although only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have locked it and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"besides, afte also documented the locking of providers, possible through the circumference of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called virtual private networks (VPNs)."</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how to block web pages that VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian people have no legal basis, with which they can proceed against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"newspapers all over Brazil report gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves smoking chemist with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a strained financial situation, the 2017 threshold of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the newspaper" Extra, "known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August, published the editorial" This is not normal "in which it announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything, however, passes from civilized standard and what is only happening in Rio will be published in the section" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Oct√°vio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes further:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police who first shoot and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harden more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cec√≠lia Oliveira claims that violence is called" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist Jo√£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio is also causing serious consequences for human beings."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to deploy means and ways that are typical of a war. to this end, the penetration into the territory of a" enemy "in which a civilian is an unclear point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" lost spheres. ""</seg>

<seg id="2801">Source: CandoAction</seg>
<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sieges and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime loyal to loyalist troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the region of East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege from Damascus, causing residents to be transported locally or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics constructs the inhabitants of East Ghoutas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria and are only very rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, they make them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, spoke to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"to collect money for the initiative, use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge for the planting of fungi, says Dr. Leila on Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have achieved over 100% of their expected target of approximately 12,700 ‚Ç¨, but will continue to raise funds on cando until Monday, September 04, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ¬∞ C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally manufactured fuel is used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they started with the" "production of fungal seeds" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a bigger bath. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila stated that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach people the mushroom culture for various reasons" ": break the siege."</seg>
<seg id="2825">Provision of a new food source on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">"spread a culture of self-sufficiency by using food residue (such as paper, tea, coffee, cardboard, etc) to collect new foods."</seg>
<seg id="2827">"creation of new jobs, especially for women who work at home."</seg>
<seg id="2828">Creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home.</seg>
<seg id="2829">"he said:" "we hope to spread this idea throughout the world, so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will be visible."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"several hundred people protested in many suburbs in Portugal on October 21, demanding justice for the victims of the fires, which were in the north of Portugal last week."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the last week of solidarity with the victims was proclaimed a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia area in Spain where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks spread in the northern and central regions of the country, and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedr√≥g√£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017 alone, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal on the shape of the wood, which the government had brought in to severe fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open backdoor so that everything could be built," Jo√£o Sorval carries out in the same article in the newspaper P√∫blico.

<seg id="2854">"the environment organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees consist of easily combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, still spreading to fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo√£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the servers did not survive the onslaught of 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time, Ashark Barati was a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>
<seg id="2876">"even if his mother didn't say it at that time, she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a few years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," Ashark remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we were not freezing at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharqi has left behind his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous passage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected asylum request, Ashark came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time ago, Ashark was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"true, Italy is a second chance for expired asylum seekers due to relatively high probation rates. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have filed an application for asylum - which can take months after the application of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who don't have money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">"but his unrestrained way of life helped Ashark, soon to liberate himself from these conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after he had done various work in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>

<seg id="2932">"the Egyptian parliament reviews the draft bill, which foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"in order to be able to use social networks, users must register within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority's website indicating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the entitlement of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was applied by sixty parliamentary members, is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>

<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police, who demonstrated violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the office of elected president Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, just like more than 700 people who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in jail for a court hearing."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently his trial was postponed until 20 May, because the prison administration failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is threatening the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, false charges, including weapons of weapons, illegal assembly, murder and corruption."</seg>

<seg id="2954">The regulations also indicate that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
