that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before ever heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular reports that N@@ SA illeg@@ ally owned teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA had literally delivered dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not coinci@@ de ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against Ris@@ en and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became the symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitu@@ ent Assembly , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if the media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were given for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
&quot; instead of spl@@ itting and spl@@ itting , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , got his phone number secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit return , and even travel tips with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government down@@ gra@@ ded too much from their work . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional proposition , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allowed to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the testimony . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which had not yet been written when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , by us , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer get information secretly , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only suppliers like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to apply mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
or the next environmental officer who will alert us to contaminated water by F@@ lin@@ t . or Wall Street @-@ Insider who warns us about the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data le@@ ak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting for the next release , and on the forthcoming documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agency or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something we have been discussing and expos@@ ing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sac Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have seen much more cases and examples that have ties to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , you need less information in some US States requiring less information to start a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers are allowed to rip off particularly prone investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African Minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really shocked us that all to a lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these attor@@ neys took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to regard this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of play . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very melanch@@ oly , as though we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen a glimpse of more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced legislation in the two parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which is now able to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after finishing my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Corps of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard of saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling , thinking , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in ? &quot;
a deer rag@@ ing in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fri@@ ghtened that I went out of bed , sh@@ one on toes to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people , who were sold to me as strangers to me in childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ ommate is moving and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , to turn fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ ommate , Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky , &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and thus founded &quot; Air Matt@@ ress and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the lock , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite strange people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still at comfort , would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , remember the things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the total experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left ro@@ ommate .
this quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
most guests feel like they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; so , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please pro@@ claim to Twitter that he is chann@@ elled to the Office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail of this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name , if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can hold really well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would like to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens the confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to give off negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their jud@@ gements before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are related to age and residence . &quot;
we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three ratings , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation p@@ ushes common ground .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted ancestors .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had previously been un@@ covered . &quot;
&quot; for us , business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to part@@ ake parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I only think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment , which was heard in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only have a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; when trust works , it can be wonderful . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know a lot . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; but now just to name the ten@@ ant industry , the thing is not fair . &quot;
share economy describes a trade that promises human relations .
people make a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place that you visit , a group there would be more sc@@ ary to fill a thoroughly and show a district in a pub that has never been heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to share together ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital city of Seoul , this project has already started . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government , &quot;
&quot; now residents are offered . students , who were looking for a place to stay , were offered &quot;
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children had moved out . there were incub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not inv@@ ent the wheel .
&quot; hospitality , even before . &quot;
there were similar sites in front of us .
why so exactly did our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
every time I have to think about when a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or just a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , the media are people who look like me . &quot;
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : the Americans think , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double esp@@ res@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a car@@ rot fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual muscle . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born this way . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , as some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adjust myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only passed passi@@ vely to the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , doub@@ ted , doub@@ ting , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow surrender that deep@@ ened itself with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
ever had the feeling that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands and yet loves somehow ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people flew out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should one do something like this ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Eastern origin ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mek@@ ka ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Mid West of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove -- as we drove around -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time feared to be recognised as Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mar@@ vel . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people that were considered Muslims , drag@@ ged and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have turned the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , ear@@ ers and Olympics . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces free , but not stop terror . &quot;
regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to viewing people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radic@@ alization , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which leads to the person who believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ one with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had made sense of their anger , it was a major target for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m re@@ establishes the connection with God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her to join the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we are more likely to accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that when people report news reported negative about Muslims , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as to circumc@@ ise the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood sw@@ ells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
Muslims &apos; cop@@ ing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ dens us all . &quot;
in the assignment of collective debt it is not just about having to explain itself .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has such a young man become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot dead eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would be controlled by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we went on sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and went out my shoes , and went into the building , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ king our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : well , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might say you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker working with depth , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study conducted in Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no way , I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a milli@@ ard business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air parcel delivery has penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting connecting devices , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding stable structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; every plane machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; attention european and german buyers : we allow you to bid on this auction , but you need to add the vat of 19 % . Shipping to a
a fli@@ pper that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in what position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
al@@ right .
&quot; during our research , we often ask fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts that join together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies are working with only one . &quot;
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner that mechan@@ ically is the simplest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically imp@@ ec@@ cable , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern roller . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right , if all of you watch is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the boom is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the bus driver with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is not only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; by this , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some are available in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , things go wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller is falling off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , although limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making a half flight in@@ capable .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we recorded commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ governed . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to imagine new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine there would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the act of creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , clever creatures allows them to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled around each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a ten@@ ths second . &quot;
this short moment they gle@@ amed bri@@ ghter than all the stars along all galax@@ ies throughout the Universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in the first place .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , a number of cell @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courage@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which significantly improved detection performance . &quot;
therefore we call him Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o started for a final test run to clear some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes hun@@ ted through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ utter in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pun@@ ched into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often conduct a really al@@ ber@@ y dance in courses for theory of rel@@ ativity . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ utter@@ ed at the meeting of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is , 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott gladly ar@@ gues Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from multiple points around you . &quot;
in tones this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; Dum@@ b Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range are .
&quot; so if we convert wave pattern into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , about the coll@@ ision of two black holes can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , chir@@ p simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; if the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same p@@ ine@@ apple with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement wor@@ ding , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o Fol@@ lowing : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear , knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate around as fast as the bars of your sh@@ aker . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circles around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to investigate the universe , as it was never possible before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- practically or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ia stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen , however , in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through as these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own lumin@@ aires . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in All things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the din@@ osau@@ r bones for our archaeological work , so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , to the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build magnificent det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say , &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of whom I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , my fear removed . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . Emer@@ son , the youngest , names all the &quot; &quot; estim@@ ations &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ asses . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magic effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I really understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sentences to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am the author . I think things out , stir you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I &apos;m producing television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series runs on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself , and not only produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing that ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just around the computer and fan@@ ta@@ si@@ ere , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not just about dre@@ aming in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I go deeper into my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is as if I set up troops , I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; to make a high note , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a sum begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could go for it forever . &quot;
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am persu@@ aded to write that writing gives me joy .
&quot; do not understand me wrong , it does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began working with television production , when I began to work and work , create , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz@@ ing , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a hum@@ ming , you can &apos;t strive other than by size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is genius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there , the more things are , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love working , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz , the hum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burnt out . &quot;
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her m@@ um is a single work institution .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
Emer@@ son says : &quot; guess I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the sons of a Tit@@ ans .
you are a baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the tot@@ als ceased . &quot;
the tot@@ als of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz didn &apos;t come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium sleeps , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the hum@@ ming was me .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a tut@@ or , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the hum@@ ming when you already knew the tot@@ e when the tot@@ als stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asked me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I don &apos;t want to say No , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; guess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; guess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I hate it when I am Titan and my hum@@ ming is smoking , and everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters b@@ ump together , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ oping . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside of me sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and this not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly comes back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I knew a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the tot@@ e , the working environment , the tit@@ an@@ um , that &apos;s just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the actual sums are . &quot;
the sums are not force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real tot@@ ality depends on love .
&quot; the sum is the current , which comes from the lust of living . &quot;
true peace is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks that have to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I am doing this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t tell me how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , for what kind of person is better than being at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we fly around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always follow my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the games ?
you can also ! say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my children want to play with me at most at most , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
it is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replace me .
&quot; and talking my teen@@ y daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more do not need it . &quot;
everyone can get up 15 minutes a day even on a bad day !
15 minutes at the track !
&quot; no cell phone , no clothes , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that children make ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming of having a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children .
&quot; to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I see . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; I saw that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of life in me spreads . less Titan ! more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am the author . I think things out , I am stir@@ ring you to life . &quot;
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thereby , one electro@@ de deeply im@@ pl@@ ines in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s suffer@@ ers suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in emergency .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that skull trau@@ ma g@@ lows down the brain and the skull pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes you need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a tissue section , it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and environment to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts he managed Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology , that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ tin positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why remain they preserved ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we placed them on the exceptional level of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we stro@@ de these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we rei@@ mp@@ an@@ ate the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury to and irrit@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we drove the motor skills range in the motor Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hands any more . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontan@@ eously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of pl@@ asti@@ cal brain mechanisms .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey who refres@@ hed spontan@@ eously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we loo@@ t the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting for us .
&quot; since then , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority permit us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multic@@ entri@@ c study . &quot;
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and tell us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as un@@ changeable entity .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blos@@ som@@ ing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy wan@@ es with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally declared to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- would not affect the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are drow@@ ning a mistake , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are crushed , our future ble@@ w and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat of our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mount , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt hill , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy as@@ parag@@ us and corporations , which are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could contribute to the debt burden and also produce all the things humanity is desper@@ ately needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the euro area , 3.4 tril@@ lion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and apply real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; so debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand which , like in an endless loop , strengthens the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
&quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him . &quot;
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; his exceedingly extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy came to many from -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they involved the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of the state . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burned quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democr@@ acies have not roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democracy @-@ free zone .
&quot; in our democr@@ acies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , as the economy slowly sub@@ ver@@ ts politics and escap@@ es it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it can be in the government today and yet not in power , since the power of politics is mig@@ rated to the economy and the divisions are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a flock of pre@@ dat@@ ors that have dec@@ im@@ ated so sustain@@ ably the animals from which they nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has radic@@ alised politics so far , that it cuts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of companies grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher are the tw@@ ins , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor recover only through a miracle a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts more deeply , as it -- very soon as I believe -- to come in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and take care that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in an illness @-@ controlled hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia similar to the &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; , &quot; in long talks to indul@@ ge in the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ good utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all mankind . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country into a mutual fund . &quot;
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have , in particular , against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ated in which they fav@@ ored privileged individuals , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself in your biography even as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do it , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is ter@@ med Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;

&quot; what one can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;

BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the unden@@ i@@ able den@@ ial that a massive drop @-@ away line ran through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; it was right to do it . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still elected den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system which is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism on life , one might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness , ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a stra@@ ined situation , he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that proce@@ eded through the euro zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that for the last 5 years they had gone through a dis@@ astro@@ us program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , was standing : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the pat@@ ron@@ ised centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be profitable for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a gel@@ at@@ op@@ ur and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to pick up the shows and the contents that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site , IMDB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received . &quot;
&quot; will your show be valued at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows who are addic@@ ted to where , after watching a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about being on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean exit , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and selected through an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch them free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is out there for nothing , do you pick up , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process them , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four repub@@ lican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to shows , their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they got a risk and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; you have two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic says somehow that it should work in everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit terri@@ fying because we live in a time where we can access more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a discharge takes place . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most accomplished companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way of predic@@ ting -- by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
&quot; it worked just fine , year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data most accomplished companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data out@@ flows into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know a lot of difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together to make a resolution . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to then hold a good resolution -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intel@@ lect , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what otherwise they would have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that wasn &apos;t in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV @-@ ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and to avoid that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will publish it later with a demo of technology .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and in retro@@ spect I should have listened to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , when you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated data analysis , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; ultimately it is up to us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
