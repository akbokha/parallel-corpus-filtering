<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before ever heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular reports that NSA illegally owned telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA had literally delivered drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not coincide?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became the symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constituent Assembly, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if the media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were given for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of splitting and splitting, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, got his phone number secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit return, and even travel tips with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government downgraded too much from their work."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistle-blowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional proposition, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allowed to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the testimony."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which had not yet been written when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by Aaron Swartz, by us, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer get information secretly, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only suppliers like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to apply misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental officer who will alert us to contaminated water by Flint. or Wall Street-Insider who warns us about the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have been hidden in tax havens].] [what does it mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Moselle Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has offices in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting for the next release, and on the forthcoming documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and obscure their wealth -- something we have been discussing and exposing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossac Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have seen much more cases and examples that have ties to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, you need less information in some US States requiring less information to start a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers are allowed to rip off particularly prone investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator turned out to be an African Minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really shocked us that all to a lawyer made suggestions to our investigator, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these attorneys took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to regard this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of play."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very melancholy, as though we could do nothing against it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen a glimpse of more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced legislation in the two parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency which is now able to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after finishing my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. then he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Corps of Peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard of saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared to the ceiling, thinking," Oh man! what did I get in? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A deer raging in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a frightened that I went out of bed, shone on toes to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people, who were sold to me as strangers to me in childhood, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate is moving and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, to turn fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate, Brian Chesky," Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and thus founded "Air Mattress and Breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the lock, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite strange people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still at comfort, would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, remember the things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel like they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"so, who now has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please proclaim to Twitter that he is channelled to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name, if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements that all say: "he can hold really well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would like to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to give off negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their judgements before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are related to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three ratings, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation pushes common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "great works of art in your apartment! I make holidays with my family." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had previously been uncovered."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to partake parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which was heard in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays only have a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, it can be wonderful."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know a lot."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just to name the tenant industry, the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share economy describes a trade that promises human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">People make a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place that you visit, a group there would be more scary to fill a thoroughly and show a district in a pub that has never been heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to share together?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital city of Seoul, this project has already started. lots of parking spaces belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now residents are offered. students, who were looking for a place to stay, were offered"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children had moved out. there were incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. through our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not invent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"hospitality, even before."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why so exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that amazingly,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about when a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay at the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, the media are people who look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: the Americans think, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a carrot fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual muscle."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I wasn't born this way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adjust myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passed passively to the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, doubted, doubting, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow surrender that deepened itself with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Ever had the feeling that someone you perceives you fully understands and yet loves somehow?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had a child later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, people flew out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Eastern origin...,..."... "Djihad..."... "bombed Mekka!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Mid West of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove -- as we drove around -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was the first time feared to be recognised as Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," Be watchful, "" Be careful, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Don't marvel. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people that were considered Muslims, dragged and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have turned the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, earers and Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces free, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque leads to viewing people of other faiths more tolerant and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalization, one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing, which leads to the person who believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their imagination, when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clone with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of unrighteousness in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had made sense of their anger, it was a major target for the instrumentalization by extremists, who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam reestablishes the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are more likely to accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that when people report news reported negative about Muslims, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as to circumcise the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood swells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Muslims' coping with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hardens us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has such a young man become such an accomplished young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot dead eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would be controlled by fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we went on silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and went out my shoes, and went into the building, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanking our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>

<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>

<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in what position the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Alright.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moveable parts that join together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: one propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies are working with only one."</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner that mechanically is the simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically impeccable, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern roller. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>

<seg id="442">"if the boom is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the bus driver with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>

<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by this, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is shot or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some are available in models, the rest is learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, things go wrong -- an engine or propeller is falling off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, although limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making a half flight incapable.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We recorded commercially available micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-governed. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to imagine new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine there would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>

<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, clever creatures allows them to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far distant galaxy, so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenths second."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they gleamed brighter than all the stars along all galaxies throughout the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set up their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, a number of cell-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer- Gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which significantly improved detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call him Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo started for a final test run to clear some smaller, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes hunted through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clutter in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and punched into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, lecturers often conduct a really albery dance in courses for theory of relativity."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stuttered at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is, 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott gladly argues Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from multiple points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Dumb Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies in the audible range are.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave pattern into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, chirp simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"if the two bodies turn very fast, you hear the same pineapple with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement wording, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo Following: [Surrender of the sound] Someone who knows what to hear, knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which rotate around as fast as the bars of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circles around one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo paves a whole new way to investigate the universe, as it was never possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can not see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why masseria stars explode in super-novae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen, however, in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own luminaires."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that in All things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, in the first attempt, Ligo found things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says:"</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work, so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, to the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, my fear removed."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes" "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. Emerson, the youngest, names all the" "estimations" "for inexplicable reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my beak-asses."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her, when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magic effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently, I really understood that the" yes "sentences to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am the author. I think things out, stir you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I'm producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series runs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself, and not only produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously, so that you understand that I'm not just around the computer and fantasiere, and it's true when I say that it's not just about dreaming in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I go deeper into my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as if I set up troops, I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"to make a high note, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sum begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy road, I could go for it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am persuaded to write that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"do not understand me wrong, it does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I began working with television production, when I began to work and work, create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzzing, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a humming, you can't strive other than by size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the humming."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a titanium, and I know I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there, the more things are, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love working, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzz, the humming."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overdone, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mum is a single work institution.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">Emerson says: "guess I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the sons of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the totals ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium sleeps, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the humming was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you're working, you're working to be a teacher, a banker to be a tutor, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the humming when you already knew the tote when the totals stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asked me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late and she says," "Mum, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I don't want to say No, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" "guess." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"she calls no one more" "guess." ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I am Titan and my humming is smoking, and everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mum, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters bump together, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Pooping. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside of me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and this not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I knew a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the tote, the working environment, the titanum, that's just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the actual sums are."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real totality depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sum is the current, which comes from the lust of living."</seg>
<seg id="711">True peace is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks that have to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I am doing this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't tell me how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, for what kind of person is better than being at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we fly around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always follow my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me for naïve, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my children want to play with me at most at most, until they think they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking my teeny daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more do not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get up 15 minutes a day even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the track!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell phone, no clothes, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that children make ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it is not necessary to be children. it is necessary to feel the humming of having a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children.</seg>
<seg id="759">"to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I see. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sum seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the humming, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I saw that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the humming."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, dying, bare and new feeling of life in me spreads. less Titan! more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this humming, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am the author. I think things out, I am stirring you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans don't have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most famous, the" deep brain stimulation. "thereby, one electrode deeply implines in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's sufferers suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that skull trauma glows down the brain and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes you need to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a tissue section, it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and environment to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts he managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology, that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doubletin positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why remain they preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we placed them on the exceptional level of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we strode these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimpanate the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and irritated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicentric study."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchangeable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blossoming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy wanes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally declared to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- would not affect the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are drowning a mistake, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are crushed, our future blew and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of extravagance, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat of our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit Paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mount, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt hill,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy asparagus and corporations, which are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could contribute to the debt burden and also produce all the things humanity is desperately needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the euro area, 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3,4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing except to inflate stock exchanges and apply real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"so debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand which, like in an endless loop, strengthens the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"involuntarily, the circumstances lead to the fact that Oedipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy came to many from --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of athenian democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athenian democracy was and is that they involved the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they grant them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines brightly, it is burned quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place, as the economy slowly subverts politics and escapes it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it can be in the government today and yet not in power, since the power of politics is migrated to the economy and the divisions are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a flock of predators that have decimated so sustainably the animals from which they nourished, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has radicalised politics so far, that it cuts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of companies grows, political goods are devalued, the macroeconomic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "of democracy, the higher are the twins, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and economy, and it would be better if the" Demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor recover only through a miracle a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste more sublime, and social conflicts more deeply, as it -- very soon as I believe -- to come in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and take care that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end in an illness-controlled hyperautocracy that makes the film" Matrix "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia similar to the" "Matrix", "or something similar to the society in" "Star Trek", "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" "Agora", "in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" -good utopia instead of the "Matrix" like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and from revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos, "and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country into a mutual fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have, in particular, against the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe you is at the same time liberated in which they favored privileged individuals, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the mülleimer of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography even as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do it, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is termed Larry Summers as a" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is accurate, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, so I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely confused."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't know, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, if I may say so provocative, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to submit to China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells enormous after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to the complacency, and the undeniable denial that a massive drop-away line ran through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it was right to do it. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, still elected denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system which is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism on life, one might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">"BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness,..."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a strained situation, he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that proceeded through the euro zone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that for the last 5 years they had gone through a disastrous program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"it is worse than during the" "Great Depression". ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, was standing:" this was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be still pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the patronised centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a postmodern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will also be profitable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a gelatopur and describes herself on Twitter as" films, TV, technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to pick up the shows and the contents that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site, IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be valued at nine and above, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows who are addicted to where, after watching a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about being on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the mean exit, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selected through an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can watch them free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is out there for nothing, do you pick up, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact they collect the data, process them, and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican U.S. senators. ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. exactly like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to shows, their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they got a risk and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"you have two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is a bit terrifying because we live in a time where we can access more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a discharge takes place."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most accomplished companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way of predicting -- by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most accomplished companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data outflows into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know a lot of difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people inconceivably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, disassemble this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together to make a resolution."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to then hold a good resolution -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and intellect, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what otherwise they would have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make a show like" House of Cards, "that wasn't in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV-ideas, then chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to avoid that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will publish it later with a demo of technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, and in retrospect I should have listened to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, when you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated data analysis, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"ultimately it is up to us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
