Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt where young people should meet today .
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , which is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich stimulates exciting stories .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that had to be exciting already because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as of Bavaria in the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very revealing . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a rag rug that one cannot recognize as such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called prototype sheets , were incorporated into towns and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bay@@ erische survey@@ ing administration , these arise between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and originate from the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops came up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; and thus the Bay@@ erische survey@@ ing management . &quot;
&quot; the document for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 , and is like all other members on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot;
the comparison of the former / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , so 1877 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : at the inside there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written hand@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original recording &quot; &quot; from which the corn@@ erst@@ ones were derived . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October Festival , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ nen &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ nen &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry atri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the premises of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; West lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in 2015 - in architectural all@@ usion to the original structure of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked by 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Allied bombs seized many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn trunk road will take place . &quot;
&quot; with the slider bar , you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to Promot@@ e Far@@ s has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ani@@ ans to pay particular attention while travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents can occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; it says in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the state who di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , the group agreed to issue the travel warnings , &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist campaigns against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , where black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring about buying allow@@ ances or letting relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crimes report of the FBI , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration violation , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interested parties have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Member of Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac got a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U place association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals accommod@@ ated and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only regional .
&quot; since he is also the Federal President of Fis@@ her@@ man bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elem@@ ental &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
&quot; the green area is a lot of work , a lot has to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not conduct a bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot;
farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry out their operation , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often critici@@ zed because of the subsi@@ dy .
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares , which until at least 2023 are not allowed to be for@@ ested . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted via Leader , a quarter contributed to the community of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained € 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiß stood firm : &quot; &quot; here , the best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Poli@@ cies ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a &quot; &quot; l@@ PR &quot; &quot; associated with the L@@ PR . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be economical ( slope climb over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the motion of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully directed down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ a Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have laugh@@ ed at him if he had done it .
&quot; but he assumed its significance , and in particular the significance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the poor w@@ reck of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; falling away &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had accomplished a high political action .
the sculpture ought to show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ans by presenting the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the significance of the statue , people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not a cash drawer , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is encountered here . &quot;
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of perception of perception .
&quot; the great fan@@ ta@@ sies of Laz@@ arus were to see them as they were seen from exhausted , el@@ usive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to acknowledge .
&quot; their tor@@ ch shall not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds himself of a time when only two bul@@ k@@ heads belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the Director of Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which kick@@ ed off on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip , who will compete against Sir mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alli@@ ons , which will compete in their fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s biggest total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir goes on this path and last year has set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season winning the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is remembered for her first world champ@@ ionships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the capitalists say that they are &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms . &quot;
concerning my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it simply will be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block@@ age of critics via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the natives of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him for all , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ ud@@ dered in the cri@@ tique , sure . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a repub@@ lican governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary witch @-@ head .
he has demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rig@@ orous adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very ade@@ pt at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans told A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor expressed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news , &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a stand on the same topic , then they are deemed to be regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the governor referred to as &quot; concentrated spam &quot; attack , others would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era simply makes it easy to listen to a message by simply blocking a critic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical car@@ et@@ ons or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was the last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the last mend@@ ment to the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable people had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; the peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with the UK , overwhel@@ med his position , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he hasn &apos;t put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days since the Renaissance club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round , before losing Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to his home ground for action . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the guy from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; I am glad , as far as I have done . &quot;
&quot; the trio on the field are former masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ rance are one of the six bul@@ k@@ heads in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with one occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary heart rate by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking on lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases can be trac@@ ed back to passive smoking a year , &quot; &quot; said Head of study Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
domestic connections proved to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ ingen road are in full swing and &quot; &quot; are somewhat in time &quot; , &quot; said the director of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since there is much hiding in the underground , which is not stated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which hin@@ ders the construction work again and again , is a big problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reign in the troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ coal bed with ze@@ al@@ ous , washed hands is removed and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work such as clothes with d@@ ull water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her no fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders agreed to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrug@@ ated roofs that have been transformed by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets of our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable Gold@@ mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort valued the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at € 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ yan demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua had been killed and thousands were rap@@ ed and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
massac@@ res in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal region in the 1970 &quot; s became the genocide of the Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is said in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal detention and torture - rape and electric shock have been particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have been reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic change is changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning Cant@@ ons sell baked chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado served with mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the local pap@@ ua , the m@@ um mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised in 2014 the ine@@ qualities and violations of the law in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann assured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an imp@@ etus to their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and killed the group with their rif@@ le @-@ guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ an Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby Government Commission was set alight and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hun@@ ts and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle on a regular basis and a bird singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to blow stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses were able to resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin was the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
Minister of Security Wir@@ anto announced in October 2016 that he will judge an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto lod@@ ged a retreat when he spoke with TIME on June 5 , and said he has no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , accused of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; for crimes against humanity , demanded that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid of being shot . &quot;
brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that people in Panama have fear of discussing the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police f@@ lowed into vill@@ agers in the neighbourhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers placed stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured have been delivered quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an inv@@ oc@@ ation of the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by offensive spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ da Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived at Nab@@ ire airport in a larger number since the opening of new routes . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and well @-@ educated migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Gover@@ ning Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions in reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French repor@@ ters Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deport@@ ed to Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asian director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development is not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s uns@@ ett@@ led eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s alleg@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ is@@ sing , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal committee . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money ; they only want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai firing victims carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried in a territory just across the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus , with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second firing , which in just two years is swe@@ eping through the high @-@ rise building , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people &apos;s cri@@ es .
&quot; we ran down stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dubai civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units counter@@ fei@@ ted fire at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said that she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the security of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen in with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the recommendation to play Davis Cup only on two winning ways was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the often very long , but even therefore very este@@ emed Five @-@ Pack classics remain the traditional competi@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 % of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the overall reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal came before the proposal to leave the final on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists will be the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the first round in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements in terms of training tables etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring illegal items into the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers &quot; passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consciously sm@@ ug@@ gling over 20 percent or un@@ consciously banned articles at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally damaged knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they were in@@ compatible with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people , which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents stated that they were know@@ ingly trying to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 per cent M@@ illenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , which were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items which were inten@@ tionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the company said it asked travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally mu@@ gs had brought sm@@ ug@@ gled goods by airport security and how many could have done it inten@@ tionally .
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely to carry sm@@ ug@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry out the safety , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they may take along or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far under@@ estimated that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k will first reveal another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose ex@@ tradition has just begun . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k adm@@ its : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only for non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 euros ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are required , in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancell@@ ations of up to 12 percent of all orders will be a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500,000 , by 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , every day 1800 reservations are made . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to greater delays , the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent uns@@ atis@@ fied customers from running away in flocks .
EPA Direct P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the hes@@ itation of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities in response to respon@@ sive measures than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is a period that ran on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 O@@ zone standards .
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt declared that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed by President Donald Tr@@ ump at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before being appointed by President Donald Tr@@ ump , has long been a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to blocking or delay regul@@ ating the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the regular roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington has decided that the EPA Administrator has crossed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane levels . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards is simply enhancing the willingness of EPA to collaborate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to adhere to the dead@@ lines for the execution , and then been waiting to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement stipul@@ ated the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who lam@@ ented the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings , and we take the dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority we give us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen takes place on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm to a seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village made the friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the Würt@@ t@@ ember@@ g@@ ische original customer book : &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the former parish church , the wor@@ ding of the document , besides the former parish church , was also a glorious courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint was , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Freuden@@ stadt fortress of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that is still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the noble settlement core of the village . &quot;
ancient maps dating back to 1600 have under@@ min@@ ed these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early Middle Ages .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the right to employ a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of them were crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were carved and the bell rows were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church @-@ chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius @-@ C@@ emetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the listen@@ er . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary Church was dem@@ ol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s eight year 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; only the tower of the tower , which is still existing today , remained the witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history . &quot;
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em take care of the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ er Rent@@ ers &quot; &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility . &quot;
&quot; as organis@@ er , friends and promot@@ ers invited tum@@ lin@@ ers on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ary Chapel . &quot;
&quot; designed by the com@@ bo of the &quot; &quot; Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium &quot; &quot; Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s . &quot;
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is speaking the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk in front of the cemetery takes place . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organisers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and audi@@ tors . &quot;
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin are particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ills &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; club hon@@ ors &quot; Board of Directors Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the elimination of wind energy for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it because of a missing fault . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval claim is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council re@@ affir@@ med the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the call .
&quot; the corresponding writings have been dealt with in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the cause of re@@ viewing the matter .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of grounds closed . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this is roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ axle households . &quot;
the NEW re will invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ trat für die Stad@@ trat für die acquisition of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind power plant at Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10@@ am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more persons were easily injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
&quot; after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch travelled with her car as an accompanying person with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; -@@ Week
&quot; in September , the city of Lan@@ gen@@ ei@@ ss and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
the business bever@@ ein and the city administration aim to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the business bever@@ ein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers to what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are invited to &quot; &quot; Mittern@@ ach@@ ts @-@ shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets the inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which indicate the production weekend , are Christian König . &quot;
city administration and commercial bever@@ ein co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; with this , the trade @-@ commerce and the city go into another phase of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offerings , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; for well @-@ being together with sal@@ es@@ on Sunday , discussions with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them to actively participate . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be newly developed or re @-@ developed . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to anim@@ ating the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly publi@@ ci@@ zed , had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities take part in the nationwide &quot; &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; -@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should be campaig@@ ning for the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says Str@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

Tr@@ ump replaced the scann@@ ed tran@@ scripts by telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border walls
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border . &quot;
&quot; the US President imposed on him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scri@@ ptions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US emig@@ rated refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia to adopt &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on traff@@ icking sent by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull : &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massac@@ res : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ old Ford mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rus@@ hed to the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle stroke - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and glan@@ cing through the wind@@ shield .
the in@@ mates were floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; scre@@ am tore the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this aw@@ ful scene , played on July 22nd , is just a night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; nearly all of them beat a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 civi@@ c rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to mim@@ ic the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were born in 1946 by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life of citizen rights .
&quot; for him , the reproduction serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community , that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to follow criminal law , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician sets a blanket over the cor@@ p@@ ses of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one ever was accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , Om@@ bud@@ sman said that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI of black color laughter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett h@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore , did not come from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they got closer from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in killing , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence and has dec@@ eived the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a &quot; &quot; electoral law &quot; &quot; massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her presentation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is based in a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we are confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened to a well @-@ rehear@@ sed survey of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here a co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors presented Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts scre@@ ams and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said n --- he , w@@ asted from my property ! &quot;
r@@ att@@ an inv@@ okes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ ed at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ hid . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people back then --- he &apos;d said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; s@@ wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a sad@@ ness is about the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays , g@@ rief &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozens of spectators wi@@ ped out sweat and tears . &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ an oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels like a ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wants to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ enberg embr@@ aces two of his fellow players and then breaks along in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ per one of the women . &quot;
we know that it is not in your heart .
you did that for one reason . &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta gr@@ ati@@ fied about the night@@ mare with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone keeps Broo@@ ks farm at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with the Wall B@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ makers pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;

the audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who are hum@@ bling and bow@@ ing his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te are celebrated . &quot;
&quot; there is a big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat in a casual casual outfit . &quot;
Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors were eag@@ erly anticipated .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a hilly piece of pipe about himself , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation , in which the occasional &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down . &quot;

&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also has grown to an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunte@@ ering year at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; crowd : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture market , once a week I &apos;ll help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I have done Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; I recognized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me , and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot;
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there one can see how it is on the spot , in the focus too , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social affairs . &quot;
&quot; I will dual study , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also part of the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that prov@@ oked me .

Pear@@ son cuts another 3.000 work@@ stations and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be started in order to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the breakdown of job reductions , General Manager John Fall@@ on , mainly for the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 points have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May in a third cost reduction program , Pear@@ son announced a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann &apos;s partner , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after a growth of 1 percent rose to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide bomb attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , a declaration by NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; pro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had run this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the U.S. troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is weak@@ ening the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states compl@@ ained of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA was announ@@ cing the decision late on Wednesday to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 , &quot; and said that it is showing the Agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in a part of the country , where inc@@ isions need to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , should stimulate economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature protection groups that are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and rein@@ force respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants to share common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln resol@@ ves the establishment of a joint space in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; although the church community is still in municipal ownership until now , there is no plan of planning for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a joint space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide an area of approx . 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council suspended such a common room not as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean housing , but openly to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ oo &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding opportunities .
the construction is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , thus T@@ j@@ adas , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed Resol@@ utions attempt to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a cri@@ pple between the legs , stating that in this respect it is not possible to throw a cri@@ pple between the legs - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces tear height and makes the construction more economical - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , this is not just Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously does it happen to the committee .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings that you don &apos;t get so much forward , but now you lean on the common room out of the window , &quot; she says , &quot; I am hard doing it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to assets or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area you don &apos;t give a surplus , but to get a real , in case of doubt mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing counter value , the return address is . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s motion to request the proposed resolution , there are three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step into closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bicycle path of the road black way from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the amount of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he apparently didn &apos;t notice the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;

FC Bayern Munich has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup runs without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel cut@@ ters , the FC Bayern will be the first destination for the new season to Dortmund . &quot;
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the recru@@ iting personnel at the German soccer record master Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 PM / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ zzi Win@@ ner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ref@@ rain from David Al@@ aba with the BV@@ B .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ nern was missing Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said , and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory pr@@ el@@ ude of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights has captiv@@ ated the fans .
&quot; the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
wander@@ ing in the resin from star to star
&quot; in the Harz , the &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to develop . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star path &quot; coming to meet the need for information of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , was it . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to place boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; readily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; welcome to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network welcome plays a part in choosing a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the train is to be expanded by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it is far away . &quot;
it will also be convey@@ ed in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Medi@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the planet path . &quot;
&quot; starting in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae goes up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; alien &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to de@@ mot@@ ed to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks thus to a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun measuring exactly 75 metres far exceeds 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path amounts to four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
&quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year . &quot;
&quot; Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future with 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super feather weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former body@@ weight , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko vo@@ iced .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans were asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network that offers the best finance package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; said Gar@@ cia , he treasure Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous compli@@ ment for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks he &apos;s &quot; &quot; Drei@@ kampf @-@ Champion &quot; &quot; from River@@ side is very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show stroke , then boxing . &quot;
they both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that needs to be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four remo@@ vals after tire placement
&quot; in the event of an accident on A7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira had lost control over his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the exit point of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was locked in the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lanes was passed by the accident site . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; Drei@@ chec@@ ker works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 at the start of the season against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ises the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result even if not the two opponents had been against Braunschweig on 2 : 2 . &quot;
&quot; these were two counter@@ parts too much , and we have to work better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain should also be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after a kick off the Fort@@ un@@ ae don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team even after the experience in preparation with the three chain gets better than with the four @-@ se@@ ater .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we just have in the tril@@ ob@@ ite on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gi@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build good , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we still better harmon@@ ise and we do not make so many play@@ things in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann will also go to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
&quot; of this , his trainer wanted to know nothing . &quot;
&quot; the start of the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ matur@@ ely due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una vs an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know that 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the outset , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Chief Coach . &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish asylum seek@@ ers
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Food Safety Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the last months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was rated over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about their age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det for@@ s@@ ook the 5@@ 81 published results , she noticed that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , when x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves ass@@ essing the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
ass@@ essing biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Road Industry and Transport in the Government Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three ne@@ eding bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a wooden arch bridge , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , has a 1.@@ 30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
&quot; this is an edge fix@@ ture , which is also used as an operating way . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian route is to get lost .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
particular t@@ act feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , first fish and cr@@ abs had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked . &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is a total of 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest against German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties are pulling in one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that peac@@ efully presents a flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites for a &quot; big election campaign . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; planned at the fountain is now taking place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a bright image that offers .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , but they also show presence at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ D volcano Eifel . he made an effort to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built lu@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; that &apos;s the right people , the main thing , it stays peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : at about 20 o &apos;clock , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle a variety of speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chair@@ person Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidates for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman of the Beat@@ rix stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officers had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is put up shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can back - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a res@@ o@@ unding with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there are in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte morgen , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and lau@@ re@@ ates of numerous international competitions and have spi@@ ed solo@@ ists in European orchest@@ ras .
&quot; thus , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the acclaimed Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both unite the desire to not only transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach stands for the two as in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos; world music &apos; is united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and the free play become an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything out , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ yn , who finally dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin sings against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I was talking about . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten heard that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot;
so it has never disturbed me or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; I just never liked it , not taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; she especially suffered under &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very seriously .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and humili@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way relative and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some describe myself as un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify the public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you many prayers and much thou@@ ght@@ fulness ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a big announcement at West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal mine from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee postpon@@ ed an explanation on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of govern@@ ors Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather stop us than working to make our country feel great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legal entities in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without a leadership and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again . &quot;
Russian Athle@@ tics CEO Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ y@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were s@@ apped away in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comment@@ aries , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence on state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the whole council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lets from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he said Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning for Mali lost in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the North @-@ Hessen Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have been thinking about a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
defense Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the still un@@ explained fall @-@ down .
&quot; she described the two revers@@ ed pilots , however , as the &quot; cor@@ on@@ ator of their professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from North Hessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
your coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave in the church . &quot;
&quot; after that the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of Defense of Ley@@ en , the re@@ formed soldiers described as &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; and captured . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flying operation of the combat helicopter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ wa@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en , did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this divided the royal house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , and she said in the message . &quot;
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
&quot; Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a hate of it , that he was not happy with his title . &quot;
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also speci@@ alis@@ es in the title &quot; Prinz@@ gem@@ ahl . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the director of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympathy for the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik has vo@@ iced over the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ atures instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope for hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; the Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swift re @-@ election of the Parliament , but does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
this was due to the resolution of the Parliament on Friday .
&quot; previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official meeting of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Party members El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 elections in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record them .
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to be scheduled on 14 January next year .
&quot; he said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l thinks it is indispensable , however , that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its continued action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament chooses the trust and chooses a successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be deb@@ ated if they are legally tested . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; v@@ est &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for senior Euro MPs to return their country to parliament .
&quot; we , of course , assume that they have obtained their land trade , which they have received via the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; distributed the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extra@@ ordinarily . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to mention a debate in the Group . &quot;
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of the Lower Saxony @-@ dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the attitude of the former Green @-@ dep@@ u@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Social @-@ Democr@@ at leader on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the Australian T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in her recent vanity and in her fru@@ stration , the politi@@ cian establishes her personal interests in the interests of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony carries on this dirty tri@@ gue game and tries to hit political capital from it .
the CD@@ U faction leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler aims to recommend El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , rejected T@@ westen , with personal care@@ eri@@ sts to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens in the Land@@ tag , but a very sk@@ inn@@ y majority of one vote . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ s , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ n@@ aissance man is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; however , my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; just like the producers , trade has to bear care that the sold products are market@@ able and health harmless . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ frac@@ tory content of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
&quot; this time , not the factories are to blame . &quot;
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the level of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any direct fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to expect economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practice of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the case of emergency . &quot;
is there only a lack of personnel or the cle@@ ver@@ est responsibility ?
it was just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent . &quot;
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be submitted is of decisive importance .
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to use only safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by the fake means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all competent authorities , that the facts are resolved promptly and without gaps . &quot;
how the football rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
&quot; the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of the European football associations , N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champion league tournament . &quot;
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ lines and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team through the wealthy family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they have to counter@@ act with legitimate income sources , which allow them to give them the break @-@ even point in their activities related to football . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had lost enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively frau@@ ght and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to surveillance of their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P reporting period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; even though Plat@@ ini has fallen away from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , will continue to sc@@ are off excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press this week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year treaty so that the sum of debt for the next five years amounted to EUR 4@@ 4,4 million in the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 launched the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be counted as legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar through payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will become amb@@ ass@@ adors and easy to figure out such manoeu@@ v@@ res for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the existing sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more alert to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot selling . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s drift by declar@@ ing that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financi@@ als of Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new fo@@ al supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has produced board chocolate for the Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end : the airline canc@@ els the order .
Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a report from the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; on request of the News Agency .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current suppliers Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white plastic panels are distributed to 14 grams per year before landing on passengers .
the Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .
&quot; in accordance with &quot; North@@ western Switzerland , &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders from 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; however , more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ producer . &quot;
&quot; as many applicants are concerned with the new tender , the Swiss does not want to disclose . &quot;
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a comment . &quot;
chocolate panels have been distributed on board their flights since 2006 .
&quot; prior to signing a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; to the N@@ ish
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge period ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd . &quot;
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels as if time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; surprisingly worked well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables that was talked about by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny kids , who will grow - nevertheless they managed the im@@ possibility to win the final part of the j@@ okes . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more to the casting principle , including a riff to the Stal@@ ker Films of the 90 @-@ er years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that looks the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point ear@@ ns a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the am@@ i@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another mad @-@ vi@@ cious plot , included in the Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt Dill@@ inger &apos;s signature band of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random mad@@ ness that might appeal to this fran@@ chise as a sort of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieves what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang , as she will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; on Amazon now reminds us of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the movie &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East vs West Ring@@ ed I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director tells us to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English . &quot;
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Reag@@ an mask is included - that it is often as a single one . &quot;
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men carrying a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make all the food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against Dru@@ gs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the Land
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and arrest warran@@ ts had already been issued against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials put large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; altogether , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ af@@ ia members are accused of organised crime crimin@@ ality , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established against organised drug traff@@ icking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian citizens mainly came to the Italian Maf@@ ia with regard to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
Weise compl@@ ains great gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner registry has significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the commission@@ er for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the local regi@@ stran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data registered there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; warned the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; because the data has not been maintained sufficiently , the quality of data in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow recovery processes considerably , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on out@@ going people , EU citizens are also aware of those who have not had to leave at all . &quot;
&quot; however , such false statements led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with it , &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government apparently began sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 years of age when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this goes forth from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , therefore , the BA@@ MF is introducing such procedures to families with children - except for inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was no longer possible , so the newspaper reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU @-@ state is responsible for refugees . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , the country can return it to the entry country . &quot;
&quot; the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with poor old children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments enough .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ person on the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening conditions of un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach , the blood donation service already provided for other people . &quot;
at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; all in all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , with 100 donations in the meantime distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ously how our bodies are created for it , and we give respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , and also un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Represent@@ ative of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ ach talked about the actions carried out in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach in the spring . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 sponsors , &quot; said the DR@@ K district council . &quot;
&quot; obviously , a few years ago , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Re@@ beer were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations for each case . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of her life @-@ juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will likely later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members striving to increase in this month , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would be expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary in order to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs may have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks , although said that now it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - at 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continued to be deb@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; extent than the markets would expect . &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank , however , emphas@@ ised that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news to the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the latest inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; income breakdown , but she added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year forecast will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which compens@@ ates for a proportion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ nel .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation was dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be attracting them over the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; very &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive since the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is especially good for those in which the existing deals are running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages close , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sex hormone pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable registration of people and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in cases of infection .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines present in the body of a person are available to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; appropriate participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this grand new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said , &quot; This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; said Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , became a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne doesn &apos;t pack and sells her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage room and mezzanine to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ crowded , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the challenge .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked up , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that he had the correct height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units provide space for all the cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; says Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so that when you slide the door very easily , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which help create an emotional attachment to a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t de@@ ar@@ est into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metre from some standard to something quite amazing .
&quot; indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an analysis of one of the largest real estate imperi@@ alis@@ es in the value of more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place at the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 . &quot;
there the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold to USD 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; principal operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns $ 316 million and has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered best objects , &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to exclude him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk @-@ bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used the security to buy the col@@ oring @-@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first each shop of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass her property on to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars in leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , Paul says , &quot; &quot; The conditions of their financial separation have become bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV @-@ star .
Fair@@ fax Media took up contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; just Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current argument , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our issue will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps new chief of staff is planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course .
here is a piece of Rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with supervis@@ ing employees on his first day of work , he was a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s White House which he wanted to repair : poor information that fell into the President &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by over@@ seeing its media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television extends decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ didate Tr@@ ump was angry due to unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were convincing , &quot; &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February of Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping tr@@ um@@ ps t@@ witter @-@ habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption involves a steady prize . &quot;
al@@ right .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit ever was &apos; under control &apos; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets without their intervention would have included more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
&quot; if his employees manage to keep away from him a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented it from causing Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material , which may promote their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors , to lead the president out of strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with cor@@ rupted le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced wrong accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked her . &quot;
Tr@@ ump las the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
selected criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population are expected and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many volati@@ le at vacation destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have put together 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online den@@ si@@ ties have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aire Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined trav@@ eller on the foot of the war , which have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn by the municipality in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their manor houses . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought back horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ged out by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defensive installations and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious residents have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back again . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably even more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks .
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal income if the Council cannot stop it .
&quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person of the council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible .
&quot; to support our evidence of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal conduct by the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Birk@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenue through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building offered the council office as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with head office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern bought the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof we have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been torn down , blan@@ kets are partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large @-@ sized showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer puts it . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position oneself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an elevated downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with about 60 rooms wants to spread around , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already conducted talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sh@@ ear@@ er . &quot;
the ideas of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define himself exactly after the amount of investments .
&quot; just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the exterior installations are also brought to the foreg@@ round , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; a large terrace is created in a courtyard , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair for US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel in recent weeks has taken up the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling for people to be familiar with the situation . &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
&quot; the CN@@ N reported that there were already first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , the oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to specifically embro@@ iled in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaigns and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , there are to be several men who acted as a re@@ public@@ ist in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under scrut@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the center and investigate the accus@@ ation whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine the present evidence in potential crime incidents , and decide whether it should be charged . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the count chambers .
&quot; most of the time , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process is always executed behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to say that it was in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. Tr@@ um@@ ps were also advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former head chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the interview .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment shows that Mu@@ eller will not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; the subject gives the Democrats a possibility to &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House supports any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special medi@@ ator in a &quot; fair manner . &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not decided against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed in this , it continued in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been employed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ aus@@ age , alleg@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been lou@@ der , he had to ob@@ struct the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him to set up investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the presentation of US media , the White House was collecting material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would release .
&quot; unlike an independent agent of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later tro@@ dden President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on dra@@ fts of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft bill on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dism@@ issed so easily . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the western ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has been solved by the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , which has a Bil@@ lion ton of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , will now travel north and will probably need two , three years , until it is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the last three decades . &quot;
a danger for human beings does not eman@@ ate from him .
&quot; according to research data , the extent of climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , for some 30 years there is a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ice @-@ cu@@ ffs in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tant background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rup@@ ting was dis@@ rupted a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is crum@@ bling there , writes A@@ WI scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never gone as far back as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece bre@@ aches at a key point . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project writes for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI @-@ data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest fan of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it is breaking up regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists argue that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow or decline in the long run and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers do not bring back the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , so many ice @-@ sho@@ ots of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have been dis@@ rupted over the past decades . &quot;
this long zi@@ pper of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the iron surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; for the decline , the temperature increase has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has risen by about three degrees over the past 50 years , thus counting towards the areas in which the temperature is the quick@@ est . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to use Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U asks to leave the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , 41 new jobs have been added to the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have left their first working day .
the teaching places in the circle are obviously very sought after .
some 620 applicants had been able to register for this year in vain .
&quot; nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 un@@ occupied areas in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; searched for , among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented approach of the application . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; public employer &quot; &quot; competition . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age from the service . &quot;
&quot; the highest time for action , so that no more dig@@ its remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the joint motion with his party . &quot;
he was already looking for a serious surprise in the day of the circle when he publicly questioned the recruitment of personnel and stun@@ ned the rest of the parties .
&quot; people want all possibilities to be verified , which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution here at short notice , the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should asp@@ ire to a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than the tari@@ ffs for the public service actually pre@@ di@@ cts . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only when one changes to a higher level , which is oriented toward professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established in which employees concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German charity organization &quot; &quot; Youth Res@@ cue &quot; &quot; because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself with detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in a statement on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have gathered all the information and judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth ret@@ tes &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the crew cap@@ tures infl@@ atable migrants , supplied to them directly by traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive away so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting claimed only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti insi@@ sted that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had been greatly reduced over the past few weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libya &apos;s citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Sea Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the Michael &apos;s chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim on hot summer temperatures .
&quot; view points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents for the long trials to reward .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , the look@@ out point to the look@@ out point , joined by &quot; flying &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and hu@@ ts brought will@@ ingly rests . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
also Neustadt was controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 m altitude the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from his best side - sporting and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing in wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages . &quot;
this is also known as the first federal ca@@ vern that is increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; that there are several associations going on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup will organise FIFA &apos;s first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile consul@@ ted an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football needs to be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will go to the stadium also in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian . &quot;

what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just FIFA @-@ simulation FIFA are fo@@ stered at a competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ es have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ever ?
&quot; for many , the idea is definitely getting used . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ l has also been dealing with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can be found in the classic sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid responsi@@ veness . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ l also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports are missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; players are on the way internationally , which is like a big global family , as there are no inter@@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) prec@@ edes the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to lie at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write . &quot;
international are many countries already on .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
a lot is happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league clubs according to Dut@@ t are meanwhile oblig@@ ated to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ President R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to decay , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
it is not possible to stick to the fact that only football remains all the same as it always was .

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy is pushing for suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been suspended . &quot;
Carter was convic@@ ted in June for Conrad Roy &apos;s neg@@ ligent killing that took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy might suffer from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance , which she de@@ pl@@ ores . &quot;
&quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said that he did not find that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity , in spite of all my pain , which we will be with us for eternity , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; tr@@ acked &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spr@@ inging from a building , stab you , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from the case by some press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended the Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced to her British ro@@ ommate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ahm of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - there is no extra motivation .
&quot; what was different on his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately even though the additional garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp L@@ ahm , and no Manuel newcom@@ er was to be seen , he made the rush to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach Kim@@ me could also suggest .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , youth players , de@@ bu@@ ggers and just out of vacation . &quot;
you prefer to distribute sugar to those with a lot of ingredients you want to keep in your mood .
&quot; thus , who has been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ahm , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ ashing as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field . &quot;
&quot; to the right rear , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ i worked in this start @-@ formation like the one who can take the helm as well . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to direct the un@@ answered tro@@ upe .
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ d@@ ded hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on Devil , come out to join the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver fail to neg@@ atively fall in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
that worked very well .
&quot; aside from Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy ran away from the defense , both besieg@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ me@@ g also tried to test for a couple of times in the set @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy said that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how un@@ familiar this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked at the game afterwards . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but certainly six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye to a few heart@@ y statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ ver an interesting proposition : &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you simply have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he no longer has to teach the new . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises bis@@ sings pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which has all been blocked by Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the largest revers@@ al of the revers@@ al sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 is supposed to be building law . &quot;
the western circum@@ ference of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country which is in the urgent need of the Swiss transport plan .
&quot; the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as is stimul@@ ated by Wis@@ sing , in the wine an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a bonus of 1000 Euro is intended for the fin@@ ite master exam and 2500 euros , when graduates make their own training within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; quickly facts are needed in the planned road construction , at the same time l@@ acked the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to hire mobility at state @-@ run mobility , only 29 places have been occupied until now . &quot;
the BC@@ CI requires more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; Christian Bald@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U spokes@@ person refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than € 20 million in 2017 and 2018 , less than suggested in the preservation of country roads . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; moreover , the present broad@@ band expansion in the country is also not@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ ing Internet connections and break@@ downs .
&quot; former Minister of Economic Affairs E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Wind@@ kraft@@ werk Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of discre@@ pan@@ cies . &quot;
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to ensure compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are carcin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases generated by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indul@@ ging the powerful car companies and to ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ fle@@ ct devices to regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car has been tested , but return to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; several employees of Volkswagen have been indic@@ ted in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could severely strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; so that the Is@@ ar visitors also take part , a raft ride through Munich on tomorrow &apos;s Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if there is again the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ bridge . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building stock is to be clari@@ fied .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to an public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True love &quot; &quot; ... the understanding for the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a protective game of wild bo@@ ars . &quot;
already last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los but@@ to@@ cks and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was temporarily one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ists , the tu@@ b@@ lance of his characters are his trademarks . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he made himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60 &apos;s the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist of cities was inspired .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures lie in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he still sits at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches still find its dro@@ ll figures widespread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his characters .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack of thousands as a counterpart .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly . &quot;
lav@@ ender is threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions reminiscent of dro@@ ught , the lav@@ ender is decreasing due to insects that are transmitt@@ ing to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in spring had much less rain and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has an impact on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ cal@@ ves , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil is not only entic@@ ing for holiday@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being suspected of the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and as the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken his office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is their editor and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ sia building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 a Special Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established to deal with the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists has initiated only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ ex@@ orable and although the terrain is still more av@@ ali@@ able . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the reason , we mis@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he was forced to ride a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter ran away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people will be shot on the street every day , or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed Maus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only one cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken down with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val card fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed ga@@ it members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not comp@@ el Val@@ dez , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story , leaving the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug poison problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to publish hard meeting without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you need to take over the task that is assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who was cur@@ sing like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gui@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their homes , run@@ ways and run@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anno@@ y@@ ance is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the space where the workers from Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were permitted . days before , it was known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who signed the governor themselves as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
&quot; it has been months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has li@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending , concentrating on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the entire century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; before we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to storage space for signs and stick@@ ers , which prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist in the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a note , which was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close how the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly set up the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with high @-@ risk choices . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that the drug trade is scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was Rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a number of fights with ri@@ val ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated on as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the on @-@ board computer , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ten close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you only remember , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; If on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to do@@ dge his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ ores of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even find that his schu@@ ppy skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she would have had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the uphol@@ stered arm@@ our din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs living in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has stun@@ ned researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; amaz@@ ement &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 l@@ bs@@ . ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you blind@@ fold only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique used as a counter@@ act , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed to move better into its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ with@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it . &quot;
the astonishing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the survi@@ ving animals . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by flesh eating din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ ev@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the Cre@@ tac@@ eous Age , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on cl@@ ues about his life , including his cann@@ ed intestinal effect , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early cycle time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you spar@@ se just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the cycle time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , who lived ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 ft ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered arm@@ our din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin @-@ locks still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured panels along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foot @-@ foot is on his side , his five fingers are fed up . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass Ar@@ mand@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ scale deposit .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ er@@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information of the police there were almost 30 vehicles between the jun@@ ctions Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( administrative district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , including trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , there was no information about the exact number of the wounded . &quot;
&quot; it is about light to medium @-@ heavy injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large range of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in direction Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilomet@@ re @-@ long trip was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ car to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between an auto transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ening in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; comes the conductor and w@@ akes up one , or tears the rider in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
credit card control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the road@@ less ticket inspec@@ tions .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and unlock the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available for many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and one has to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; it is also necessary to have bought it through the App of the Rail , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test certificates , a button for electronic de@@ preci@@ ation appears . &quot;
the train attend@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train attend@@ ant arrives at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspec@@ tions by our train attend@@ ant , check out in the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their journey more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , the Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs .
&quot; who often rides , knows that besides delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions are one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , in any case one of the fellow travelers will not have all the documents needed for the de@@ preci@@ ation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document that one has to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train attend@@ ants and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment letting them hire and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it still lies on the road , &quot; said it there . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live . &quot;
&quot; he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ine body , stretched out on the street and left there for four hours . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people who cried , and of a man claiming to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman took his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded of her statement . &quot;
this is not the sort of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 pm she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell and her daughter , who wore a floral dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; black experience and the black state &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
what has happened today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no lat@@ ent racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
&quot; I feel , I would turn out to be a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis the President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film , met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said that she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar chose to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came into mind : &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ked passengers . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project near@@ er to Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; during the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ and &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as they fall in love and mar@@ ry her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt as naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Matter &quot; in social media , identify himself as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is actually held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; at which Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news security cameras have disappeared in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway during a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; however , she cl@@ ings to a voice and she feels committed to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;

from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves humans , although it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves a cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be a real class &quot; ( Nicole Rock@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ itter ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while advoc@@ ates build a gallery attracting more clients to the city , of which other businesses also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be an end . &quot;
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Keller : &quot; we have been buying in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always happy again . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low with the new project . &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; why shopping branches in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
one can see how many stores are empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is well worth the price . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop@@ ke@@ epers are only hired by larger firms in a shopping mall because the local rentals are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; what a pity , specialty stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmer @-@ market hall be gone during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes in .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place . &quot;
&quot; once the farmers market is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts you were sent from Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former Secret Service Analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly checked diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A suitable res@@ emb@@ lance ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ la and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg embr@@ aced the DNA analysis of the DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ t and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while being in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use became un@@ equal bricks , exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed images , &quot; which fores@@ ees a future in which the president would convert the president Chel@@ sea@@ weed and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able roads to further infl@@ ame the rigid circuits which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation &quot; whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides in accordance with the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) to show how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring along is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ urious Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA dates can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing as she emerges from the discipline of discipline in the United States like King Kong .
&quot; when they make your speech , they have won , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of space by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ums that are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented , as all in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , as the movement , which also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford
a nationwide human ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which became suspect after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27th .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the spot , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ garbage , the vice president for university relations , said in an email explaining that La@@ them had now been excluded and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail declaration that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ators in every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , which said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timet@@ able has been updated in this respect , &quot; explains Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s timet@@ able for compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that could cause any concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list however stipul@@ ates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian Law@@ yer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; m@@ um@@ my &apos;s words agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , the WA@@ DA was exp@@ elled from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
it was however allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organization in July , WA@@ DA Director @-@ General Olivier Nig@@ gli , declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit to track their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that at the head of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance industry may have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial @-@ technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , scent businesses can send custom @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS Hot@@ line to report bad behavior with the employee .
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that is poor@@ ly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has implemented Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company Conver@@ t uses Conver@@ t , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were seated in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice - quicker identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take care of ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violation by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; in November , Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t used . &quot;
investors can achieve Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement is important according to the experts in the workplace culture .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , dis@@ appointment can breed and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you will not follow employees , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better relationship between employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you &apos;ll also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customer , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have moved off their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is a real pedal for the boys the next three days , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during mor@@ as conducted six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to do 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he would support N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change in rules , even if they added another point to the multip@@ lier routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in the face of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been raised with foot@@ balls that ro@@ bs a protective network behind a gate post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video bit of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ checking in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false error messages and to send them to invo@@ ices , which may display results of the invoice verification from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled posting such as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts test is started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fact @-@ inspec@@ tors are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;

in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney had experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opol@@ itan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historic documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the im@@ print on the page of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ minded person in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters are always sm@@ elling smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) it all seems too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hybrid heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 , when the last hei@@ r , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees just started to care about the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ o@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let it all go his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ver@@ itable Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant insurrection began in this area , and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ rons who hid the Dar@@ rell family for seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the sm@@ ug@@ gling Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in filled with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite gri@@ m to keep debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men rede@@ emed their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ lady . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the bloody life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Lady chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf envel@@ oping
&quot; with the consec@@ ration of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Lady chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef was launched on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau ) . &quot;
&quot; still until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Art@@ z secret the logo and slogan . &quot;
at the end of August it will be the highlight of the campaign to give a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the campaign asked for yesterday the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; she wrote on her yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we believe that as Bad Honne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; with the action it is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef makes its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on reti@@ ring and promotions in the officer &apos;s cor@@ ps . &quot;
this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in former times , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government now also the five deputy ministers , as well as the ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ lap . &quot;
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the forces of air and the n@@ avy were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the leader of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who allegedly participated directly in the attempted coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since that week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of God as &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really get a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ scarf ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the security guards at the army and security forces continue . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan led another 73@@ 95 state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mo@@ ist , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the actual masters of the country earlier .
&quot; three times , they appe@@ aled to their role as a guar@@ dian of secular state order . &quot;
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan insi@@ sted on the power of the military step by step , not least of his appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; magazine , a specially @-@ called officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , NATO could not let Nato become cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he pre@@ fers to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens from other countries get green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for racing bus shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months over the future of the racing pav@@ ement has been cont@@ ested - now it &apos;s supposed to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , there is to be built at the mar@@ o@@ da route , where the tourist railway is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of the grid , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and refurb@@ ish the route Il@@ men@@ au Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; explained the State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of repair of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently voted conclusi@@ vely , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the southern Thur@@ ing@@ ia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; in this way , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be scheduled to be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle &quot; &quot; is a popular rail link between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by sufficient number of people in order to re @-@ order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also very steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we have to start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ agel . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will get them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples right up to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a st@@ eppe @-@ woman look progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved into robots with a silicone membrane .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot lets users adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ies developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes whatever you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female attributes , the all@@ usions to rape if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , fre@@ t one the most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and growing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R recognizes their growing popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
but what le@@ aks out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market for this is permitted .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened around the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ iled to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Mag@@ d &apos;s Report &apos; ) is not the graphical images , the intri@@ cate body and the out@@ going eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the phant@@ asy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a pl@@ atitude of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers in the USA about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump loving relatives .
we all rig@@ or@@ ously strain ourselves to place our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noted is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , to bring together families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family who visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
&quot; with tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows it , including the repub@@ lican kin@@ ship , with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is noticeable to me that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his kit@@ ties will no longer rep@@ el us . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ian version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal off@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the biggest of the square in the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the atmospheric music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park car@@ ousel is still a strange magical experience , since two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , during this week I was forced to review my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral replacement , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he report@@ edly suffered in his cell in prison . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet building in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly in@@ tru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too pru@@ dent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger , that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a curious egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler from F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; as a symbol for the school , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eag@@ les , who grows in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Lower Sch@@ ar conducted a musical entitled &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to break out of his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a hen &apos;s throat , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ads , the cylinders bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle was standing for the integration , &quot; &quot; said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished for every quad@@ rup@@ ed that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; there followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps into instruc@@ tion@@ ships , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time was over now , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , they only leave their students very reluc@@ tant , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in the process , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight First Cl@@ asses are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illeg@@ ally p@@ aging people in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have shar@@ pen@@ ed the control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose considerable fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the affected have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel @-@ drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel top , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emission behaviour of cars from the Euro 5 emission classes and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE Car Club Europa offers assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no . the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; the obligatory updates only apply to the vehicles that have become the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
its retro@@ fitting has ordered the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) power station .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation over the next few months , but not yet called a precise date . &quot;
Daimler announced to address each affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is already due , that will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fitting be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the hang of the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long does the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to make an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE tells you to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE is afraid .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
&quot; to date , there is no loss of value for older dies@@ els in rural areas . &quot;
the ACE tells you to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of Washington &apos;s most gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first awards ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first R@@ apper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards by the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural direction announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot;
awards are presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the award @-@ winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced it to ren@@ ounce participation in the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ised , she will use the discussion with Tr@@ ump to clarify her view . &quot;
Kennedy @-@ Zentrum ( Kennedy @-@ Zentrum ) named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
&quot; the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will go to pension next year . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker has been a city builder .
and the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the classroom .
&quot; he reports of varied but also demanding tasks , which await his followers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it mar@@ vels that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile . &quot;
&quot; at the next possible time , the city is looking for an architect or engineer . &quot;
&quot; so , considering the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a review . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub @-@ building law authority , the applicant must demonstrate corresponding degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city and itself is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good spirits between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the town li@@ vable , &quot; he is confident about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , diversified projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking area are about to be found . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will be@@ ech with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it correctly , &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a master builder of large games room .
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ aft &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ising the discern@@ ing city forem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister takes high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
&quot; in support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , according to information from the City of Has@@ lach , he should demonstrate a completed study as a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt accommod@@ ates high@@ - and civil engineering , structural engineering , basic acquisition , administration of urban property , municipal farm with building yard and municipal gar@@ dener , as well as under construction supervisory authority , including monuments protection . &quot;
bicycles on lines thrown : South railway line closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the rail@@ road pass in the area of Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators come from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; close to the scene , witnesses have been seen by a shock@@ ing roller driver and a bicycle driver . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ ring , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators had brought themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the road traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay arc and the cost of rail transport , even sponsors of rail customers could also get to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern route could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten celeb@@ ri@@ ties had fallen on Friday morning , two of them concerned the distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains failed , but they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 meter overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; incur@@ able condition , affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ences , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the conducting expl@@ orer , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflamm@@ ations are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell can be found in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also occurs in humans . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doc@@ torate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been kept separate . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omen of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA sequences and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were wound up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given to L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria work on the immune system , the researchers caused L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated by the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as in@@ dol 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers dup@@ licate the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells rose by about 50 per cent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us will protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the present of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season of the season before the UEF@@ A Super Cup prev@@ ailed against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and reached only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho granted that he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
besides M@@ atic Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; this week , the Independent insi@@ sted that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wished for three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the Boeing aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
&quot; pilots flew from Seattle to the US State Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertisement in the past .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new envelope for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social democratic prime ministers at elections always looked to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; merely no fault fire from the party central , but no head@@ wind from the federation - this was the most important wish of the bal@@ lot fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind . &quot;
there were depression .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against the co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; that shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not reliably rule , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U general secretary , Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition was losing its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Party Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ westen sec@@ rec@@ y in Lower Saxony to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Bureau of Finance and Elec@@ tions of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD bal@@ er si@@ gh@@ tens , when the new Job Message reaches the party central on Friday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the accession of the Green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without his own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades fell down at the time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
this was the case - and it became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the tum@@ ble , the Du@@ essel@@ dorf sh@@ ou@@ ted the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after , Com@@ rades were struggling with difficulty . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived . &quot;
and with him came the next envelope .
&quot; Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country leader , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burnt . &quot;
&quot; and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication after that , which can be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
and now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in criticism since a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey results added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because in recent weeks Wei@@ l tried to acc@@ entu@@ ate the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden from comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they left him as they promised to stabili@@ ze the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Green . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; at times , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the deci@@ de@@ dly parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen combined her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to Parliament by the National Bank of Lower Saxony , the Lower Saxony Parliament . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , voters agree : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the parliamentary election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of future CD@@ U members distor@@ ts the election results , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
grant of Local Auth@@ orities III
those who want to be rehabil@@ itated into the years can soon get assistance from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EC city development were informed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been providing rehabilitation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is important to promote the interior development as well , and not only to open new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the community sens@@ ations . &quot;
how is a renovation zone created ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EG adverti@@ sed Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ se . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; where the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is revit@@ alization of internal cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and developing infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out , that is , per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the trial period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the survey would be carried out only once , within the framework of those involved in the restructuring area involved a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the set @-@ up decision is to be carried out as soon as possible , so that the restructuring can begin next year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations . &quot;
it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances and decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
a re@@ mark in the land register will be registered for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ el emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and grounds &quot; &quot; where it is about the construc@@ tional condition and the renovation measures . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information on size , layout and residents of a housing space can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; Operating Ar@@ ch &quot; &quot; can only be filled when operated in the building premises . &quot;
&quot; however , it is important to note that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler continued to emphas@@ ise that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - who first comes , grin@@ ds first . &quot;
one cannot reserve funds for later .
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; local core II &quot; &quot; were shown to make a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its Bio@@ Te@@ q company . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedures are carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a n@@ avy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that elev@@ ates American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s data that have been left to the TIME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House , made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht made of Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft made from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news revealed that the helicopter hit the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the tur@@ f was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the hours a second team would be required for return flight .
&quot; during the event , the original flight crew was during the helicopter , while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time . &quot;
the recordings provided by TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of airplane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation as the presidential airplane paid off against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area in order to reduce U.S. pres@@ idents in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; as tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have Bud@@ get@@ nick@@ names for the Pres@@ idency , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the State Department for Budget 2017 , the Do@@ D refund rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for refund rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the yearly funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , refund rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the top of the second tennis league has won the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; on the back positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , the imports from the high North are mainly concerned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella , Fr@@ ench@@ man won &apos;t be able to join the Bundes@@ liga team , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for its first use in this season . &quot;
&quot; the Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo , previously un@@ defeated , was at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el yesterday with the Weiß@@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories , last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one in the Junior World Ranking by January 2016 , does not fill one out of the train@@ ee at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay to the cad@@ re . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump did not work really happy , when he set his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for the ti@@ ghtening of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; Congress said a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US offensive . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of domestic OM@@ V , jointly with other European companies , are concerned with the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea coast Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would even have to raise the sanctions per executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; looked at what the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the spotlight in the series of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer is revealing , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from passing . &quot;
&quot; the relay three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the newest bu@@ cks of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) command the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ oz@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on 1st September .
to roll back : the city puts 46 kitchen hel@@ pers
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lun@@ ch@@ time again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is turned back .
&quot; as of September 1 , Kre@@ feld will be taking over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) in self @-@ governing . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and delivers fresh Gek@@ a @-@ cooled refriger@@ ated .
&quot; the city operates 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children will receive a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the past kite year , 2,@@ 800 children were seated at the tables , and the need grows continuously . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 weekly hours are in the &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; lunch , &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 : 00 .
&quot; 46 partial @-@ time forces have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them around salad , raw vegetables and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individual , give off the meal , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ squ@@ ad facilities - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more integrated , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because it is also about healthy diet and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the Kü@@ ch@@ enk@@ punished people to the team would be useful .
for the children too .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also function of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has found in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign ownership for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 persons , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , appointed Director of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are candidate in the provinces in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women are fully participating and included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
Taliban have released threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to a consult@@ ative role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

men attempt to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request but went on with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , but that was mis@@ erable . &quot;
without loo@@ t the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers have a long @-@ term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which apart from other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch manager of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s request , &quot; &quot; express concerns that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be driven forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ino manager at T@@ oll@@ cross just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ onian site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has PS@@ G Barcelona warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La Liga may rep@@ ent its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar again after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona for three years before the incident of the world ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is mad about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world for@@ e@@ warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a stern warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players at PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to make one of our players sign up , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to rip off under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ ed and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has thrown down a sco@@ oter in the Royal felder Straße in front of the number 30 sco@@ ot@@ ers and so on the covering of the vehicle damage done by more than 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for cl@@ ues . &quot;
&quot; for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because a car came to suit him on his track , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touched the guard plan . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old came from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW against 19.@@ 55 hrs on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction to Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the location of Stol@@ zen@@ au there was a passenger car approaching his track , so that he had to reti@@ re to the right . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Tour@@ an @-@ driver touched the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; in the car , Sach@@ sen was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it may be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver didn &apos;t notice the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the cause @-@ aware , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report of the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen goes further for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ person for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication against the German press agency , he expects the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican journal &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that when reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is measured with &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one doub@@ ted that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful action &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that is a found fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a completely normal educational tool &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; to be finished with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often also appeared . &quot;
&quot; author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger sum@@ med up the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer appointed by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg has presented with the clari@@ fication attorney Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be assumed that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. , forms of physical and psychological violence were applied in many cases . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the disciples was even more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even link positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the ruler Dom@@ sp@@ atzen of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence practice on shel@@ ters at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of &quot; &quot; Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for one thing , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became pal@@ p@@ able to the oil , when a domain kit didn &apos;t bring any top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in the first place at all . &quot;
he has just eight pages dedicated and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , it is possible to repro@@ ach him , too late , or to have the first hints not taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was experienced by virtually all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony , &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always been surrounded by grapes from children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; he did not only but@@ ton@@ ed with chairs and threw the mu@@ zzle on the ground , but also kick@@ ed ears and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he even admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; in his hon@@ esty , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frag@@ mentary time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horrible sexual abuse and the violence in the pre @-@ school , it is certainly bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 3@@ 18 4@@ 44 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e many , who never understood him , are still eager . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about abuse has been reported on the topic ab@@ uses in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger published in the final report also some involvement or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the domain master .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said one of the afflic@@ ted others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questioned student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely findings and could have been able to stop the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it is absurd ... even for really absurd , to assume that ... more urgent or clearer or more open to him than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , beliefs , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report concludes : &quot; that students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any ro@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of preventing it or being brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; had to be read by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former mayor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge cluster of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is precisely the report of the report .
&quot; it is therefore clean divided : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly sli@@ pper@@ y and portra@@ yed , all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that , like most witnesses , the theme &quot; Prim@@ ary School &quot; was tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : although discipline prev@@ ailed , there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him , despite violence . &quot;
at most it remains the accus@@ ation to have looked away .
&quot; despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again about 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consequently en@@ close his ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Acade@@ mic gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out that , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the punishment penalty should continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time , as legal clarity , as testing sentences were banned in Bavaria as well . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as everyone of us probably know . &quot;
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit had been crossed .
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he would have always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the death penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time . &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right .
&quot; but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous at all times and not for what was ban@@ ished in the pre @-@ school of resist@@ ances and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
that &apos;s all terri@@ bly and I am glad that it is finally being worked up .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so as to draw ears and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he was strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; has played in the talks with you ? &quot;
was the subject of testing fine as well ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI explains from his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all admit that there was a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would probably have been impossible for him to form an institution of world @-@ rank , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t even make a great vo@@ cal@@ ist and stand before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive , as many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , still today , 23 years after his retirement , regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
today most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is thank@@ ful for him that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to whom she still has to watch and to honor her . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything you repro@@ ach him are educational methods which were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have already overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the stand @-@ up area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , would probably not know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
