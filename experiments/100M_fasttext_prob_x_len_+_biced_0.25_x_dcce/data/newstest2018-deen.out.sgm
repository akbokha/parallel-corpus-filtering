<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Anstalt where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich stimulates exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that had to be exciting already because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the geoportas of Bavaria in the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a rag rug that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called prototype sheets, were incorporated into towns and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bayerische surveying administration, these arise between 1810 and 1864, and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops came up with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801, they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "and thus the Bayerische surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the document for Munich dates back to 1856, and is like all other members on the website of the Bavarian State Library."</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the former / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, so 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: at the inside there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten handpieces from the so-called" "original recording" "from which the cornerstones were derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "land in the sun". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October Festival, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street names" at the Gasteig "or from the hill" Auf der Lünen "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich District-Irrenanstalt" "Auf der Auer Lünen" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry atrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the premises of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected in 2015 - in architectural allusion to the original structure of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II by bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was marked by 1856 as" "main square", "the Kauferstraße was called" "Kaufinger Gasse." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombs seized many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk road will take place."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider bar, you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to Promote Fars has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourianians to pay particular attention while travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents can occur in the entire state and be noted here," "it says in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the state who disproportionately target minorities, the group agreed to issue the travel warnings," said the NAACP. "</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist campaigns against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri General Public Prosecutor's Office, where black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring about buying allowances or letting relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crimes report of the FBI, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration violation, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interested parties have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Member of Parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU place association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals accommodated and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the Federal President of Fisherman bach, he described the electric fence project as" elemental "." "</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area is a lot of work, a lot has to be worked with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not conduct a biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hope that the reforestation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry out their operation," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticized because of the subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares, which until at least 2023 are not allowed to be forested."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted via Leader, a quarter contributed to the community of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained €12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers". ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiß stood firm:" "here, the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Policies (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-art promotion of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The pre-requisite is the presence of a "" lPR "" associated with the LPR. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be economical (slope climb over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"at the moment, the motion of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully directed downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Fira Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have laughed at him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he assumed its significance, and in particular the significance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the poor wreck of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "falling away" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had accomplished a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture ought to show the connections between French and American Republicans by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not a cash drawer, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"rather unusual, Limbaugh is encountered here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great fantasies of Lazarus were to see them as they were seen from exhausted, elusive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wish to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch shall not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds himself of a time when only two bulkheads belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Director of Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which kicked off on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special in Scotland" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip, who will compete against Sir mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought quite naturally were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medallions, which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's biggest total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir goes on this path and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season winning the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is remembered for her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the capitalists say that they are" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">Concerning my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it simply will be such a great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blockage of critics via Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the natives of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him for all, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shuddered in the critique, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overpowering democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary witch-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum, is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans told Amelia Chasse the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor expressed the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not bottled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news," "she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast" The Post. ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same topic, then they are deemed to be regarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the governor referred to as" concentrated spam "attack, others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era simply makes it easy to listen to a message by simply blocking a critic, or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical caretons or to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was the last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County is the last mendment to the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable people had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"the petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with the UK, overwhelmed his position, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he hasn't put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="256">"of course, too late to work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders agreed to vote in front of the occupying troops."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island."</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's unsettled eastern provinces of Papua and Western papua: visa denial and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua including the Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="440">"one day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era's rules to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants."</seg>

<seg id="443">It is a period that ran on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 Ozone standards.</seg>
<seg id="444">"in June, Pruitt declared that he would delay the observance of one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid" "interfere with local decisions or to impede economic growth."</seg>

<seg id="472">"in addition to the former parish church, the wording of the document, besides the former parish church, was also a glorious courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint was, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>

<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church-chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>

<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius-Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the listener."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>

<seg id="756">The decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding opportunities.</seg>

<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to assets or even foreign investors.</seg>

<seg id="797">"in the Harz, the" "star path" "is to develop."</seg>
<seg id="798">This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.</seg>
<seg id="799">There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="800">"a" star path "coming to meet the need for information of many Harzvisitors, was it."</seg>
<seg id="801">"he connects nature, science, movement and athletic performance."</seg>
<seg id="802">The members want to place boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.</seg>
<seg id="803">"in a first phase up to 2018, the association plans" readily accessible installations at five to six locations "in Oberharz."</seg>
<seg id="804">"welcome to St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber."</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be supplemented by internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"therefore, a good mobile network welcome plays a part in choosing a location."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the train is to be expanded by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the star path, the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained. "</seg>
<seg id="810">"in addition, they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another, although it is far away."</seg>
<seg id="811">It will also be conveyed in which constellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see.</seg>
<seg id="812">"since 2014, the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andreasberg, the highest observatory in Northern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="813">"according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="814">Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly.</seg>
<seg id="815">"since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein Mediarium Göttingen, there is something similar to the planned star werg - the planet path."</seg>
<seg id="816">"starting in the Goetheallee in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path with its stelae goes up to the Hainberg and to the observatory - as well as an" alien "site in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna."</seg>
<seg id="817">The stelae with the individual planets - including the Pluto demoted to the dwarf Planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="818">"the earth shrinks thus to a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter, while the sun measuring exactly 75 metres far exceeds 70 centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="819">The entire distance of the planet's path amounts to four kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="820">"while the light from Sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto."</seg>

<seg id="862">"with the first season of the season, Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result even if not the two opponents had been against Braunschweig on 2: 2."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two counterparts too much, and we have to work better in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three-chain should also be further optimized."</seg>

<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more than Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team even after the experience in preparation with the three chain gets better than with the four-seater.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how we will act in Aue," his trainer Friedhelm Funkel says, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we just have in the trilobite on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gißelmann players who can build good," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we still better harmonise and we do not make so many playthings in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann will also go to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can talk about a miserable start, don't know."</seg>

<seg id="875">"the start of the season only after six to eight playing days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, only because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna vs an ascension favorite."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know that 100 percent where they are currently," "says the inner defender of Fortuna."</seg>
<seg id="878">"indeed, the guests from the Rhineland are a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep it away, just because we have the right to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="884">"the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are older than 18 years. however, not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Food Safety Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migration verket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor."</seg>
<seg id="887">"to date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was" possibly 18 years or older. ""</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are stable over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the last months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said, The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was rated over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that" suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet forsook the 581 published results, she noticed that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year."</seg>

<seg id="897">"a sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can't say it sure, we should not do as if we could," "he said to the newspaper Metro."</seg>
<seg id="901">"Göransson from Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect. "</seg>

<seg id="917">"the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach, on Wednesday morning, has a 1.30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap."</seg>
<seg id="918">"this is an edge fixture, which is also used as an operating way."</seg>

<seg id="1122">"the rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of the European football associations, Neymar's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain will not disturb."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champion league tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must point out that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make the money loose so that Neymar underlines and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the wealthy family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but they have to counteract with legitimate income sources, which allow them to give them the break-even point in their activities related to football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini for his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had lost enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively fraught and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to surveillance of their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP reporting period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"even though Platini has fallen away from the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, will continue to scare off excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press this week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year treaty so that the sum of debt for the next five years amounted to EUR 44,4 million in the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 launched the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to oversee their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be counted as legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar through payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar WM will become ambassadors and easy to figure out such manoeuvres for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "the existing sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more alert to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot selling."</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England will likely later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with less members striving to increase in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would be expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they signalized that in the next few years, interest increases would be necessary in order to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit and said that credit costs may have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets."</seg>

<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's final judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation was dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will be attracting them over the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said the exceedance in relation to its target of 2% was "very" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "in view of the recent downfall of the swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive since the lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-sex hormone prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by health service to a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>

<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable registration of people and further clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in cases of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines present in the body of a person are available to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"appropriate participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt-in for a possible participation in their local sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this grand new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping one of the biggest health challenges of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said," This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>

<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We sincerely welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"said Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, became a Earls Court apartment in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne doesn't pack and sells her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and mezzanine to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overcrowded, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked up, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that he had the correct height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"on both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," says Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so that when you slide the door very easily, it glides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor - or how your property is estimated," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which help create an emotional attachment to a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't dearest into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metre from some standard to something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"indeed, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave it."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>

<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to USD 85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburb."</seg>

<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with supervising employees on his first day of work, he was a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House which he wanted to repair: poor information that fell into the President's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame trump by overseeing its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television extends decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was angry due to unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were convincing," "said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February of Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keeping trumps twitter-habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, insists that his personal media consumption involves a steady prize. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Alright.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit ever was' under control 'is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps tweets without their intervention would have included more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees manage to keep away from him a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from causing Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump Material, which may promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors, to lead the president out of strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with corrupted leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," "being the source behind a heap of leaks" "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for Schikanen, or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has voiced wrong accusations in the past and revoked her."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump las the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his counselors are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1420">The police all over Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer (virtual) postcards.</seg>

<seg id="1428">"some of the wealthiest landowners of the West Midlands stand again with some determined traveller on the foot of the war, which have traded a ditch drawn by the municipality in order to reclaim a field in front of their manor houses."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"the travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road from Solihull, which is called the" "millionaire series". ""</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought back horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, without being deterred by a ditch digged out by the Council to prevent their seizures."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in defensive installations and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"furious residents have pushed the council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said:" "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by."</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it, as it was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"the travellers were there in May, were moved and are now back again."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"more came last night, probably even more."</seg>
<seg id="1437">She added: "the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks.</seg>
<seg id="1438">I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal income if the Council cannot stop it.</seg>
<seg id="1439">"a local who didn't want to be called, said:" "it is ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, only to be looted by another round."</seg>
<seg id="1440">"the numbers have increased this time, and you even saw a horse in the park area."</seg>
<seg id="1441">A spokesperson of the council of Solihull said: "we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenue through the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in autumn 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district, the hotel building offered the council office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with head office in Bad Bergzabern bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are welcome Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof we have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the soils have been torn down, blankets are partly broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Until March there is still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large-sized showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should later become" "beautifully bourgeois", "as Thomas Scherer puts it."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position oneself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with about 60 rooms wants to spread around, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and director director Michael Krause, so shearer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city were identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define himself exactly after the amount of investments.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he calculates."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior installations are also brought to the foreground, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"a large terrace is created in a courtyard, which is open to the public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Issuer sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the panel in recent weeks has taken up the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling for people to be familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the CNN reported that there were already first pre-invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps, the oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to specifically embroiled in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaigns and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, there are to be several men who acted as a republicist in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under scrutiny."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump has personally moved into the center and investigate the accusation whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the present evidence in potential crime incidents, and decide whether it should be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always executed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to say that it was in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. Trumps were also advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former head chef Paul Manafort during the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment shows that Mueller will not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an accusation."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," "Trump said."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject gives the Democrats a possibility to" "feel good" "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement, he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but they usually work in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House supports any action that accelerates the work of the special mediator in a "fair manner."</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not decided against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed in this, it continued in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been employed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rausage, allegations against Trump have been louder, he had to obstruct the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump has asked him to set up investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the presentation of US media, the White House was collecting material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller would release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent agent of the congress, such as in the Watergate affair about the later trodden President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on drafts of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented the draft bill on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic Eisberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western antarctic, a gigantic Eisberg has been solved by the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This divided the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, which has a Billion ton of heavy and 5800 square kilometers, will now travel north and will probably need two, three years, until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest giants that researchers have registered over the last three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for human beings does not emanate from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to research data, the extent of climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, for some 30 years there is a series of unusual interruptions of ice-cuffs in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factant background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxing and abrupting was disrupted a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelfeis is crumbling there, writes AWI scientist Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never gone as far back as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaches at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only in small dimensions, the British research project writes for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI-data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest fan of Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it is breaking up regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists argue that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will continue to grow or decline in the long run and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers do not bring back the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, so many ice-shoots of the Antarctic peninsula have been disrupted over the past decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long zipper of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the iron surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">"for the decline, the temperature increase has contributed."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has risen by about three degrees over the past 50 years, thus counting towards the areas in which the temperature is the quickest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to use Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free places, the CDU asks to leave the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"just before the summer break, 41 new jobs have been added to the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching places in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applicants had been able to register for this year in vain.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"currently, there are still 50 unoccupied areas in the district of Mettmann."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"searched for, among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term demand for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented approach of the application."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented towards internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a real" "public employer" "competition."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who excrete disease or age from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"the highest time for action, so that no more digits remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the joint motion with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">He was already looking for a serious surprise in the day of the circle when he publicly questioned the recruitment of personnel and stunned the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all possibilities to be verified, which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfying solution here at short notice, the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aspire to a Haustarif," "says Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than the tariffs for the public service actually predicts."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money there is only when one changes to a higher level, which is oriented toward professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be established in which employees concerned about the provisions of the new prostitution protection law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the Councillor Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little personnel."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone on NGO migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German charity organization" "Youth Rescue" "because their team effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself with detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor's Ambrogio Cartosio prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge any accusations that are currently raised, after we have gathered all the information and judge the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'youth rettes', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that the crew captures inflatable migrants, supplied to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can drive away so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting claimed only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organisation doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti insisted that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had been greatly reduced over the past few weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libya's citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Sea Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and Sights."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michael's chapel above Deidesheim on hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"view points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were repeatedely longer ascents for the long trials to reward.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, the lookout point to the lookout point, joined by" flying "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again many altimeters.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought willingly rests."</seg>

<seg id="1613">"in future, sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the stadium racing in wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This is also known as the first federal cavern that is increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is certain," "that there are several associations going on this train."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup will organise FIFA's first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen has meanwhile consulted an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football needs to be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people will go to the stadium also in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>

<seg id="1627">"in e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike, "or just FIFA-simulation FIFA are fostered at a competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, Lies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and with the Asian games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport ever?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is definitely getting used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobl has also been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can be found in the classic sport - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid responsiveness."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Frobl also sees problems:" doping is becoming more and more a topic. ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports are missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the way internationally, which is like a big global family, as there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) precedes the e-sport a rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to lie at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport" is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte advisors write."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already on.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez take part in the US team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood Actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition Unicrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">A lot is happening in Europe too.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the soccer league clubs according to Dutt are meanwhile obligated to set up an e-sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB-President Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia to decay, and to clarify the old times, is no longer sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been suspended."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was convicted in June for Conrad Roy's negligent killing that took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">"the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing:" "my family is uncomforting."</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy might suffer from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any regrets." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters's lawyer said it was a" "awful circumstance, which she deplores."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"however, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy who said that there is "no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for eternity, in spite of all my pain, which we will be with us for eternity," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys Sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was" tracked "by the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to commit another suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, springing from a building, stab you, I don't know there are many ways," "she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is switch the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the case by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"one of the few who defended the Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to her British roommate in Italy in 2007, before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1695">"well, the entry could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign of the coach Kimme could also suggest.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight year old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, youth players, debuggers and just out of vacation."</seg>
<seg id="1698">You prefer to distribute sugar to those with a lot of ingredients you want to keep in your mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">"thus, who has been chosen to take the heritage of Lahm, can only use a little extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimi confirmed: "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old was flashing as a mini-lame over the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"to the right rear, this is his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all, Kimi worked in this start-formation like the one who can take the helm as well."</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions and tried to direct the unanswered troupe.</seg>

<seg id="1714">"for example, Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimi said goodbye to a few hearty statements in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard of Süver an interesting proposition:" what goes here, I have already noticed. "</seg>

<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 is supposed to be building law."</seg>
<seg id="1732">The western circumference of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country which is in the urgent need of the Swiss transport plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020, says Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees a signpost to support regional, but internationally competitive enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims, as is stimulated by Wissing, in the wine an Rhineland-Palatinate label, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1759">"the companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called deflect devices to regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car has been tested, but return to normal driving conditions."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which in spring had much less rain and much more in autumn.

<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf-calves, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>

<seg id="1808">"shoppers, guilds, dealers, vagaries, or a refugee camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days."</seg>
<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and stomach feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being suspected of the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and as the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken his office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is their editor and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Riodosia building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 a Special Prosecutor's Office was established to deal with the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists has initiated only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in the case of Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inexorable and although the terrain is still more avaliable."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the reason, we misstrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he was forced to ride a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "twelfth river." ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter ran away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people will be shot on the street every day, or that the graveyard is full of ornamented, two-storeyed Mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken down with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of the rival card fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, presumed gait members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not compel Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story, leaving the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug poison problem, "Bojorquez said."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish hard meeting without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria Moors-Cabot Prize "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take over the task that is assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was cursing like a dockworker, the friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guiabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their homes, runways and runways."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the annoyance is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the workers from Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were permitted. days before, it was known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who signed the governor themselves as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has licked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state spending, concentrating on the governor's hometown."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the entire century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers had viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the Valdez office was dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers, which protested against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist in the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked her to be re-divided by the government, because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to hold your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found together with a note, which was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel:" here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were beside her separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close how the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly set up the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page" "What do you want from us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with high-risk choices."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade is scared."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I was Reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sum up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of fights with rival rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated on as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the on-board computer, they released the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Siren heulten close to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez cast a look at the policemen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only remember," "said Bojorquez," "If on the same day when Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to dodge his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible Nashores of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts described it as" Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well preserved that they could even find that his schuppy skin was of reddish brown - and they said she would have had something of an "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the upholstered armour dinosaurs, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurs living in the middle of the Cretaceous Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well preserved condition has stunned researchers, who describe it as" really remarkable, "amazement"</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 lbs. (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blindfold only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that these herbivores, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique used as a counteract, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed to move better into its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markwithchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the surviving animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by flesh eating dinosaurs that the evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosevrier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators must have been the Cretaceous Age," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including his canned intestinal effect, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you sparse just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the cycle time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, who lived tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 ft) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered armour dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the skin-locks still cover bumpy armoured panels along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right foot-foot is on his side, his five fingers are fed up."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass-scale deposit.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous wounded, kilometerlong Staus - and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"after the first information of the police there were almost 30 vehicles between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (administrative district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, including trucks."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there was no information about the exact number of the wounded."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it is about light to medium-heavy injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of bailout vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in direction Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of Munich, an approximately ten kilometre-long trip was formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as a AZ reporter reports, it also came on the counter-car to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers who now have to reckon with delicate penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 6: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepening in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: mufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"comes the conductor and wakes up one, or tears the rider in the middle of the workflow."</seg>
<seg id="1991">Credit card control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the roadless ticket inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and unlock the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will then be available for many other long-haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the train devaluation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use it, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And one has to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have bought it through the App of the Rail, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"for the" comfort check-in "works: one climbs into the train, calling his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test certificates, a button for electronic depreciation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train attendant arrives at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, keep on working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspections by our train attendant, check out in the DB Navigator."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows the passengers to make their journey more personal," says Michael Peterson, the Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often rides, knows that besides delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest annoyances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for many times, however, in any case one of the fellow travelers will not have all the documents needed for the depreciation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document that one has to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of Brown's lifeline body, stretched out on the street and left there for four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people who cried, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman took his rifle and cried," "I will kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell reminded of her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the sort of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11 pm she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had" "black experience and the black state" "countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "they remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no latent racism, she is no different from the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel, I would turn out to be a bad service to keep it away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis the President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film, met Sabaah Folayan."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar chose to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came into mind:" do you want to document, or try to find a story you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestraked passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project nearer to Ferrell, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "during the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrand's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents from" Whose Streets? "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as they fall in love and marry her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt as naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager, Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media, identify himself as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," and we are constantly fighting on various fronts. "</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is actually held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action "at which Ferrell has been selected as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news security cameras have disappeared in Ferguson, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she clings to a voice and she feels committed to this memory since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves humans, although it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian area splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves a cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit-gallery say," that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be a real class "(Nicole Rocksten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Bitter) or quite simply:" megalomania "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates build a gallery attracting more clients to the city, of which other businesses also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for Beda-Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Keller: "we have been buying in the farmers market almost every week for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also that.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct market marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low with the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "why shopping branches in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is well worth the price."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shopkeepers are only hired by larger firms in a shopping mall because the local rentals are often unsustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"what a pity, specialty stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmer-market hall be gone during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes in.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost bit gallery before to expel all business from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"once the farmers market is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts you were sent from Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Secret Service Analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly checked diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transla and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg embraced the DNA analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created out of 30 portraits, like someone with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while being in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal bricks, exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" Suppressed images, "which foresees a future in which the president would convert the president Chelseaweed and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable roads to further inflame the rigid circuits which he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her superlarge signature (the" i "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the" automatic fragmentation "whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides in accordance with the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist) to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring along is that our genome is not concerned who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA dates can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she emerges from the discipline of discipline in the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they make your speech, they have won," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of space by the masks, from their own genomic simulacums that are like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also goal-oriented, as all in the exhibition, up to size (5" "2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, as the movement, which also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford which became suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Cook County Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the spot, and detectives investigating the stitches as murder, while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubgarbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an email explaining that Lathem had now been excluded and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail declaration that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investigators in every conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them strengthen," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects. "</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip, which said something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Laws and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said. "</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Vizepremier Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA timetable has been updated in this respect," explains Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">"the PM commented on the second part of WADA's timetable for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause any concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria listed in the list however stipulates that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian Lawyer Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in regards to the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"mummy's words agree with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales agency rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"nobody has to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, the WADA was expelled from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015."</seg>
<seg id="2196">It was however allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2204">"Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"and even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed. "</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" "said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement."</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat-card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies are coming to see that at the head of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment, in which those who have spoken have been punished."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"for start-ups like Glint, this is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the global governance, regulation and compliance industry may have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial-technical site Let's Talk Payments."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"cent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">Forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"like Glint, scent businesses can send custom-made" pulse "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat-maps of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS Hotline to report bad behavior with the employee.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has seized the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"when a company is found that is poorly treated or behaved unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has implemented Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now that the company Convert uses Convert, problems that were previously hidden by managers who were seated in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - quicker identified and addressed."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">"companies began to take care of ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violation by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on-line.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have moved off their tricot-tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 am.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a real pedal for the boys the next three days," "said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday to Tuesday."</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during moras conducted six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to do 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">"Mora said he would support NCAA's change in rules, even if they added another point to the multiplier routes of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous strain three or four days on it, and it is very challenging," said Mora. "</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they simply pushed it through, they placate themselves, they are great people."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"I think, as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"the UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which in the face of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of upscale class, which has already been raised with footballs that robs a protective network behind a gate post, will not be an easy task."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," said Mora. "</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it is not far fetched to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="2277">"if you have the video bit of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal."</seg>
<seg id="2278">"but we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8."</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney had experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historic documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the imprint on the page of a letter, which was written by a double-minded person in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins." "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters are always smelling smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") it all seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hybrid heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening, gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" Whiskey "and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes met a decade later, the employees just started to care about the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years, in which Aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that represent who possessed something:" one could think that land conflicts would be boring, "Rhodes says," but there was a birch fighting for the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let it all go his way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Kniveritable Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant insurrection began in this area, and I thought an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', portrayed by the smuggling Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin filled with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family from Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite grim to keep debts and spend money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell's men redeemed their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to advertise landlady."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2322">"it was like:" "Oh, now I have to cope with the bloody life again."</seg>

<seg id="2333">"with the action it is about more than" "just" "a logo and a slogan, it says further."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"it is important to formulate an ever-standing promise, one that gives the city a unique selling proposition."</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retiring and promotions in the officer's corps."</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">"the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as in former times, but in the Prime Minister's office."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"under the chairmanship of the heads of government now also the five deputy ministers, as well as the ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs."</seg>
<seg id="2344">"as a result, the civilians in the YAS were in the overlap."</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government attracts the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"the Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commander of the army, the forces of air and the navy were removed."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals."</seg>
<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the leader of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who allegedly participated directly in the attempted coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since that week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow of God as" God's gift, "as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really get a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the paper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Discomfort in Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff, there are concerns about an increasing" Islamization "of the army, which manifests itself among other things in the abolition of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the paper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the security guards at the army and security forces continue."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan led another 7395 state-of-the-art moist, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the actual masters of the country earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they appealed to their role as a guardian of secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan insisted on the power of the military step by step, not least of his appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is driving forward an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the" "Vocal Europe" "magazine, a specially-called officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt, the Turkish army will be" "full of extremists and Salafists in a few years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2362">"if this is true, NATO could not let Nato become cold."</seg>

<seg id="2369">The bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and Co-Founder of FRR, we have to start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernagel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will get them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of the nipples right up to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a steppe-woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot lets users adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the Roxxxies developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes whatever you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed to conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the subservient female attributes, the allusions to rape if one goes a step on Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, fret one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" "it says on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and growing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR recognizes their growing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market for this is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened around the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has boiled to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Magd's Report ') is not the graphical images, the intricate body and the outgoing eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or a background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything, which could disturb the phantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney as the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a platitude of the trump-era that the political divisions, which polarized the U.S. electorate, also split families in small-format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA about how to deal with the horror of trump loving relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all rigorously strain ourselves to place our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noted is the power of Trumps, to bring together families."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family who visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with trump in the White House everyone who knows it, including the republican kinship, with which they fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is noticeable to me that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalisation "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kitties will no longer repel us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans normalize the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today, I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urian version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both compared to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal offense."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the square in the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bulky and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the atmospheric music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"so many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream."</seg>
<seg id="2442">"thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Toppub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big roundabout in the north of London."</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will go to pension next year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - suitable applicants are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years Wacker has been a city builder.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied but also demanding tasks, which await his followers."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it marvels that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">"at the next possible time, the city is looking for an architect or engineer."</seg>
<seg id="2542">"so, considering the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for a review."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administrative community as a sub-building law authority, the applicant must demonstrate corresponding degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the city and itself is important to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as good spirits between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have gathered to look back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the town livable," he is confident about the Bauamt and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, diversified projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen parking area are about to be found."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still subject."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter will beech with some 1.5 million euros," if we do it correctly, "says Wacker."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design is available for a master builder of large games room.</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslaft's own yard and gardener, many things can be reacted flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection, it is important to have" an eye for what fits "when new buildings are approved, emphasising the discerning city foreman."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister takes high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," "in the end everything runs here over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"in support and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor stays long, Wacker wants:" we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if you want to inherit Roland Wacker, according to information from the City of Haslach, he should demonstrate a completed study as a graduate engineer or Bachelor's degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the Stadtbauamt accommodates high- and civil engineering, structural engineering, basic acquisition, administration of urban property, municipal farm with building yard and municipal gardener, as well as under construction supervisory authority, including monuments protection."</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike from the railroad pass in the area of Leoben Straße (B116) to the leaderships."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators come from two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"close to the scene, witnesses have been seen by a shocking roller driver and a bicycle driver."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lausitzring," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch on APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrators had brought themselves into great danger and jeopardized the road traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay arc and the cost of rail transport, even sponsors of rail customers could also get to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, rail traffic on the southern route could be guided without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten celebrities had fallen on Friday morning, two of them concerned the distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains failed, but they had delayed."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meter overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"incurable condition, affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulences, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the conducting explorer, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammations are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell can be found in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"it suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also occurs in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been kept separate."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomen of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced in DNA sequences and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were wound up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given to L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria work on the immune system, the researchers caused L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated by the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol 3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers duplicate the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells rose by about 50 per cent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us will protect L. reuteri in our gastro-intestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans like mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the present of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2609">We will help him sooner than later.</seg>

<seg id="2611">"this week, the Independent insisted that Mourinho wished for three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a" fantastic job "to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations."</seg>

<seg id="2624">"merely no fault fire from the party central, but no headwind from the federation - this was the most important wish of the ballot fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally."</seg>

<seg id="2630">"after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against the coalitions of the SPD and the Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"that shows once more: red-green can simply not reliably rule," "said CDU general secretary, Peter Tauber, the German editorial network (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising fraction of a Greens deputies threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the election, its red-green coalition was losing its one-votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green Party Managing Director Michael Kellner asked Elke Twesten secrecy in Lower Saxony to give back their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU signifies a clear falsification of the electorate's will.</seg>

<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the accession of the Green deputies Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority."</seg>

<seg id="2656">"the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover, to expand his power in Berlin, did not remain hidden from comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz."</seg>

<seg id="2664">"Ms. Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate, but has been elected to Parliament by the National Bank of Lower Saxony, the Lower Saxony Parliament."</seg>

<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs."</seg>

<seg id="2718">"in addition to a yacht made of Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift made from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news revealed that the helicopter hit the South Lawn on July 17th at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long stayed until the turf was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the hours a second team would be required for return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"during the event, the original flight crew was during the helicopter, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time."</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you are locked," "the deputy commander answered."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was called the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was in the Senate and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the yearly funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week that are produced in America," "Spicer said."</seg>
<seg id="2752">And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>

<seg id="2897">"in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said:" we are happy to go to the church and that is a found frescoes. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows a completely normal educational tool" "had been" "to be finished with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often also appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger summed up the book" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take protection from Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which the lawyer appointed by the diocese Regensburg has presented with the clarification attorney Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be assumed that by Domkapellmeister R., forms of physical and psychological violence were applied in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the disciples was even more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even link positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the ruler Domspatzen of Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence practice on shelters at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a conflicting picture of" "Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger". ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one thing, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who became palpable to the oil, when a domain kit didn't bring any top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in the first place at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violent excesses at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, it is possible to reproach him, too late, or to have the first hints not taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium, on which it worked, was experienced by virtually all respondents as - as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony," sincerely, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" honest, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teacher, who provided the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always been surrounded by grapes from children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only buttoned with chairs and threw the muzzle on the ground, but also kicked ears and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he even admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"in his honesty, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fragmentary time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the violence in the pre-school, it is certainly bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if you have any questions, please contact us on Tel.: + 49 5764 318 444. or contact us per email."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope many, who never understood him, are still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot about abuse has been reported on the topic abuses in the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger published in the final report also some involvement or complicity in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "said one of the afflicted others," "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have been able to stop the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it is absurd... even for really absurd, to assume that... more urgent or clearer or more open to him than to their parents, dormitory leaders, beliefs, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report concludes:" that students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any rogue."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of preventing it or being brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violent excesses" "had to be read by the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former mayor Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge cluster of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the report of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is therefore clean divided: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly slippery and portrayed, all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, like most witnesses, the theme" Primary School "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: although discipline prevailed, there was no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him, despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most it remains the accusation to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again about 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consequently enclose his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Academic gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out that," "that in the pre-school, the punishment penalty should continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time, as legal clarity, as testing sentences were banned in Bavaria as well."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as everyone of us probably know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he would have always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the death penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrendous at all times and not for what was banished in the pre-school of resistances and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all terribly and I am glad that it is finally being worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, so as to draw ears and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he was strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "has played in the talks with you?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing fine as well?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI explains from his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all admit that there was a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would probably have been impossible for him to form an institution of world-rank, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, you don't even make a great vocalist and stand before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of whom one can't imagine that he could do something just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive, as many former Domspatzen, still today, 23 years after his retirement, regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today most Domspatzen is thankful for him that he enriches their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to whom she still has to watch and to honor her."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything you reproach him are educational methods which were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have already overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand-up area, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, would probably not know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
