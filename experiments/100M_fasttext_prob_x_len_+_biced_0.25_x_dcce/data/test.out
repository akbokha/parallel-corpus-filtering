&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , informed the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had secured his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; one spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working as a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .

Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has clearly made the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or stuck from outside labels , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather snow@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; &quot; cosm@@ opol@@ itan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of television with a casual Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the white @-@ glu@@ t they bring the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all @-@ inclusive mother of two sons .
the film runs from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their part@@ ying , they drove home to the feed trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and with that the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
&quot; he left his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite impressive .
the German sport aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
awards do not lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already bl@@ amed him .
long is the 18th Prize W@@ inners of the Sports Pyram@@ id .
&quot; in Aachen , on Saturday , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for athle@@ tic successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros the same . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold US master @-@ champion was induc@@ ted into the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the award @-@ winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the jumping stallion Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved into the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza Award ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger had a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trading agreements - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
about the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts small and cau@@ tions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax@@ ing the economy to death and regulate them to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will greatly reg@@ ain regulations , and he makes a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to accomplish , it has disadvantages to open up and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost the same . &quot;
the Democratic candidate declares the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ ap@@ a wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans strictly .
&quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , party @-@ internal discussions could also come . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and re@@ boot the coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement he wants to termin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , specifically wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ er trade deal , do not want to sign them . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should then also be better paid , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ er@@ ce , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the large discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics argue that the budget deficit would only increase .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are alone , almost everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby who is at most one year old .
one has put her small son in his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles shortly and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene acts normally .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social aid services in Bavaria , and among other things she deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are P@@ oultry .
&quot; in the south of Munich , they live in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs established the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - either not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ ef@@ ers to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , honor kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this continues . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , are ir@@ re , nar@@ rated B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters are often regarded as inferior and at worst mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations only for them , challenges B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project like in Munich , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , d@@ fled women are not housed separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Lower Francon@@ ia , there are stor@@ eys or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or are accommod@@ ated together men and women , it may become - ongoing - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; first of all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; as the women feel this need for protection , one can read on the impulse given to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has spoken around that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
resident investig@@ ators argue : demands for new job campaign measures
representatives of the assistance physicians have called their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; &quot; persistent , quiet &quot; , &quot; which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official re @-@ negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistants of this year strike six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the B@@ MA assistants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that were recommended by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile appeared dirty , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but to improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper reported that Erdoğan would have beha@@ ved as if nothing had happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , lasting radiator showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s response at the time was rag@@ ing .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia .
the crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
building the confidence will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most seriously the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he fought this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received an ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been enth@@ ron@@ ed at a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat in almost his office last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late ais@@ al rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulates it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry at the West , as its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power is considered a weak response . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who insi@@ sts on pulling out of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
Russian state leader gained a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat sought support for the elected state institutions .
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that have driven themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both the pres@@ idents had said at the press conference that they did not even seize the issue .
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally avoided tac@@ kling a question of its differences , while Putin chose to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for Scotland customers
&quot; according to the Bank Chief Executive Officer , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized headquarters and IP@@ O are to be changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the retail business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will raise the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of brands , for how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal about three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves his 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ face @-@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ sel , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pic@@ ks up the che@@ ek when he fet@@ ches victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ former winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career . &quot;
&quot; ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone only a few years ago .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already obtained 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and grand tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has won nearly 30 years winner in GB which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve w@@ reck@@ ing .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a prohibition of drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty at first when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his least 50@@ th birthday .
Russian Putin fired Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ issed his staff chief Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in a statement issued by the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian President &apos;s administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy head of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned institute of Moscow International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Government and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your job as a head of state concerning bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked Ivan@@ ov to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants and works as he worked for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff with@@ drew on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - pushed on great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust plac@@ ards for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President &apos;s administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin reached the power he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people , whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , President Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term Putin &apos;s term had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally by Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he proposed producer
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios which produce the series announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
the set came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love criminal min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;

mystery around the fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
&quot; a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish , who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that 75 fishes might be able to act as sand@@ als , which have been sp@@ un by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives around 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; that will approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
business Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering from a truly epic dimension to this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connecting between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge decoration is at its place and the last section of the deck is getting ready for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last pav@@ ement and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck in expansion , we had to close the gap between the north or the country side . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards on an ascent of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI Res@@ cue Center kick@@ ed off on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim in safety , while their boat moved on their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst , &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat beyond their reach , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bu@@ o@@ y hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all went aboard the ferry boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have fortunately become un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot @-@ engine had a emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone today has wo@@ ken about these men .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alco@@ holi@@ zed perpetr@@ ator dism@@ is@@ ses the clothing of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ erts his sister as a result .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street she met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds up convenient apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens will say , &quot; &quot; investors should be put much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will have to show up 20 percent of all apartments in social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and is still to be financed should provide incentives .
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; not@@ withstanding that , so Brat@@ mann , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; but the program does not yet fully stand out : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do we compens@@ ate for the loss of other approximately 1300 affordable housing that will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 flats . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing flats back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; on one shot , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; for in the west city , the year @-@ end dead@@ lines run out . &quot;
approximately 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners .
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased again , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called interference . &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a large majority , the CD@@ U has to go to the boat . &quot;
I concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worthwhile &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; in the last decade , teenagers and children do not want to go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens , has been su@@ ed by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on TV , then on video games and recently limited to smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
&quot; of course , I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on characters , initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later , a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more user than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed by a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable rise in steps which the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot;
&quot; cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , watched 3@@ 5,000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of downstream users who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; came on de@@ af ears , because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look el@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonder of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt for new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are m@@ ür@@ metric spo@@ ils that always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , anyone could run against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even when Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be slow@@ ed down with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

&quot; brilliant , brilliant . &quot;
and now finally also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year old American gymn@@ ast killed on Thursday for multiple battle titles and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
&quot; the total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt at the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ competition title and the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the sport of the last three years , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected a last test in Brazil , a competition not so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , as she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on it , during its long way to the top , never planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
part of their bottom exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition @-@ competition , a winning series that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ afa was easy to carry through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
floating Bars and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Champion title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sat on top with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embr@@ aced her sof@@ tly as she expected her end - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ cked on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her book @-@ book , became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance R@@ ais@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa by a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her cultivation , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has quite a new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims killed in a serial killer when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who were killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass killer raid , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police reas@@ oned that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y attack , as the Att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the gun@@ fight led the investig@@ ators to look at a closer look if they were connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; all in all , seven persons were killed in nine attacks within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; commented Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ in from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness shared the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which ab@@ dic@@ ated on an empty truck truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his age , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage this .
I did not let myself down on that .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course one has left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to see them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a help@@ mate .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the Sign Language that Ed@@ mund chose for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him symbolic language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not typical drawing language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of those infected with the Z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is reminiscent of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I always asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday overnight .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags were increasing . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
weather service decre@@ ed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while still raining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record level throughout the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that an up@@ stream of the river in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as it will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams have always t@@ apped people out of the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , has risen sharply over night . &quot;
he said that he would have warned him another step @-@ son who lives near .
&quot; we are awake and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a stron@@ gh@@ old of the river in the 48 years , in which she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that the emergency hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread quickly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities are considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer was near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and shared lessons in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS Affiliate EM@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the leader of the congregation of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the Municipal Administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ess said that it still ruled on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ded , but on Friday they were not reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; exter@@ min@@ ated by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police reas@@ oned that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week , the second time that a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the lung , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at the hospital in his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was en@@ chan@@ ted by spheres , &quot; &quot; told his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I just cannot believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .

brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 year old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police found out whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpetr@@ ators .

it seems that it was clearly a continual struggle .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I present to myself in the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at each Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three female gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , who is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , makes everybody proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflecting the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was an A@@ fr@@ o American woman among female gymn@@ asts .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the unbelievable achievement of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ly G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual campaign for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this kind of sport , but we don &apos;t see gymn@@ astic classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to make it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymn@@ asts in the team . moreover , that &apos;s the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but reality is such that gymn@@ asts play a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts first and foremost in private gy@@ ms that are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnis@@ hing , travel , competition , and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
&quot; the majority of these turn@@ tables are located in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business . &quot;
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ lasting commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started exercising . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the municipalities au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible exercise . &quot;
I founded my sports foundation for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic club@@ team and thank you , you were motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
resident doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 resident physicians who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to for@@ ci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; No Man Land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance physicians should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve maintenance at the same time . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ person of the B@@ MA Committee for Assi@@ sted Physi@@ cians , stated last night in a message : &quot; assi@@ sts have made serious concerns about the proposed agreement , in particular that it will address the current workforce crisis and to ad@@ minister it to meet all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors drop under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by discussions have appe@@ aled to the government for the sake of reluc@@ tance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to the promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the vibrations and address the concerns of the resident physicians . &quot;
&quot; should he not do this , the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting doctors on strike post@@ cards . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist Treaty with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better weekday remun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called for the assistance physicians to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work campaigns achieve nothing but little , but we already have over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ ers and their families only worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the past two months , we spoke to the committee of the assistants and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as deployment , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ pro day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after being advised by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot;
N@@ ICE regulation N@@ ICE recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE regulation N@@ ICE recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0.000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that c@@ aches the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood c@@ lot tri@@ ggers , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the launch of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to bro@@ aden available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft does not recommend any treatment that goes beyond this period of time .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness flour@@ ishes in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud is know@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities as a devastating report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , ex @-@ member of the cabinet , attacks the police , elec@@ tive ob@@ servers , and town councils to dis@@ regard pro@@ ofs of electoral mis@@ use due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an ant@@ an@@ tical king , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside elec@@ tive cabins to protect favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should take a passport with them , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must merely name its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ remo@@ ve@@ able inks to a person &apos;s finger , when they give up their votes in order to prevent anyone choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by non official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also aims to protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year a special electoral dish decided that the current mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be dism@@ issed after a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis of the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ choice - in which older members of the Muslim community made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guidance of exp@@ ul@@ sion to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; evidence has been applied to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; intoler@@ ances concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection to stop &quot; &quot; elections &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report submitted by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration procedures , in order to avoid that the electoral list is used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
&quot; do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone choosing twice . &quot;
perform systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic selection of letters .
ban that political activists edit full post@@ ings and envel@@ opes of post@@ elections .
the police have the authority to set off barriers for election stations .
a change in the law which facilit@@ ated an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the repression of the People Act 1983 .
photographer &apos;s ban in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally en@@ force that voters go to the cabin alone .
&quot; Sir Eric coinci@@ des with the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no punishment . &quot;
&quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - found guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; ab@@ h@@ ak@@ tions &quot; of the voting rights of the town hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The court judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympics sport@@ s@@ men in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are advised by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of the border and the band , which proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gänger of Cambridge . &quot;
but the 24 @-@ year old Olympic Champion is by far not the only ath@@ lete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when one is allowed to believe the social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood &apos;s celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the track @-@ track , many people on the Internet referred to how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ celeb@@ r@@ ity could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received the mad@@ ness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see any great res@@ emb@@ lance , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I hate that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ Spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big , expressive eyes should be able to pass through as a doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one gang higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor .
&quot; a further sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mann , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ ons Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and pale hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes &quot;
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
theory put into the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the gymn@@ as@@ tics Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he put his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free sty@@ ling squ@@ ad@@ ron .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been taken aboard the C@@ BS &apos;s comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost its decision , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went as low , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ eted , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; has died like a pig ? ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get cap@@ turing that they were still on stream .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese Chin@@ es@@ in lost its decision , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many were talking to him . &quot;
Twitter users did not think back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like r@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming service broadcast . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate phrase , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in people responding to the emer@@ ald via Twitter
the commentary box Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s behalf
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it was broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers at the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media .
&quot; in order to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot;
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said very sorry .
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the m@@ ason Anniversary in the C@@ BC Arena , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the Flo@@ at , and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman tried in the middle of business sham@@ el@@ essly under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see them , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a mar@@ row to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered , as she looked at it , pulled her out and put them back to the shelf . &quot;
you rum@@ bled on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the pri@@ mar@@ tin shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she moved back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she simply stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everybody star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf again . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t want to go back and kick@@ ed out .
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had ta@@ sted .
Davi@@ dson : 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; how di@@ spro@@ ve to think that someone would take shelter with home who had a different person and who were not washed .
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I got along the staff tried to pull out clothes from the sale after they went - what &apos;s just as good .
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she was not washed .
&quot; a speaker at Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident which occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from armed forces with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if you get closer to you from behind , then you should first turn around , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; hit him with his knee in the gro@@ in and twi@@ sting you while the Att@@ acker cr@@ ushes back pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; for att@@ ackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and turn it away so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the gun and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ di@@ cts Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y the saf@@ est thing is to submit your money - unless you are a master mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right che@@ ers for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k crashed his train at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rail@@ ing toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before le@@ aking each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to us what it is meant to be . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought to block the sink pot of a draw toilet which has been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he le@@ ck@@ led , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to rail stations to sin@@ flus@@ hing of toilets , the task turned its immune system definitely under a rehear@@ sal &quot;
&quot; in the film , he said : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ be@@ x line showed a lumin@@ ometric speed of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to le@@ ak off after its lumin@@ ometric speed was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; showing the bacteria count in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve o@@ iled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
&quot; I will not lick anything here , because it is disgu@@ sting here inside . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .

&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New Products N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended telling us &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direction , added : &quot; let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had checked out some of the things I had told him , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others , in which it was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these fil@@ thy goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported l@@ actic acid bacteria particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products containing added l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative was shocked by the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls had cl@@ inging holes on , wooden boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was emb@@ ell@@ ished to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who worked for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this estate is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive scre@@ ams , strikes and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down , old j@@ unk was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were opened . &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall Housing forced her and her partner viol@@ ently by the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ og@@ ations were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were not afraid of anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always terrible .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would abh@@ or the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step in consideration of Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope this development will give sol@@ ace to some neighbours and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground
&quot; house@@ keeping workers will now have to dig up garbage mountains , which surround the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after having found a guilty verdict by the owner of a drug of class B .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were emb@@ ell@@ ished with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will del@@ og@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row , by the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , announced that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without accus@@ ations , as well as those who were damaged by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after a ti@@ rel@@ ying military jet flies
&quot; sun @-@ wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force deployed an incredible crash
&quot; the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no risk of safety . &quot;
this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists start panic after a ti@@ rel@@ ying jet becomes crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ots showed how the military plane flew near to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers stopped when they were understand@@ ably starting to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ yo added : &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me .
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew amaz@@ ingly low .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet saw a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during summer where four people on the island Madeira came to death .
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible due to circumstances - heavy fog and fire smoke , which restri@@ cts his vision . &quot;

Super cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - Barcelona &apos;s FC Barcelona will fight for the first win in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the battle for the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the retreat will rise three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Double@@ bass player must ren@@ ounce with the inferior Cup@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europa League Champion , among others , to N@@ ey@@ mar , who compet@@ ed in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter also lacks re@@ cl@@ ining chairs . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the question at Bar@@ ca at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years .
&quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique finally ren@@ ounced a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er reti@@ res in most other applications . &quot;
&quot; before the first complete game of the new season , the Spanish champion doubts about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at 3 : 2 in the trial of S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. had not really convinced . &quot;
&quot; again Sevilla has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ longing the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far 11 successes , Barcelona has won the record winner in this race . &quot;
MA Long in your own league to table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the World Champion leader@@ board won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to get into the final game as expected and made the title one another .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches . &quot;
they had with@@ drawn to the grand@@ stand and left their ou@@ tra@@ ys in fair competition on their own .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches to here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said consequently . &quot;
after the game posed gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ al .
with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old Ma only had to fight really in the first set .
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the record and dropped a total of 13 points . &quot;
the supre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected stir@@ ring match .
but nevertheless there were plenty of stunning ballo@@ ons to see .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the match against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had pulled a ri@@ b @-@ injury after that , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have become similarly high table tennis old Olympic @-@ V@@ oted .
Donald Tr@@ ump spati@@ ally ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ old of Utah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as reported correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ lican camp from the race , doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt are false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ y
Utah is normally a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump and his competitors were indic@@ ted by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not with the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview of the Sender program , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is doing nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach the end for political correctness in the end , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to cancel funds to support his campaign , he should not present any better results . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans are more inclined to seize the Congress under the arms . &quot;
brain : thre@@ ef@@ old sc@@ am in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipline of discipline .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee informed immediately a disciplinary mission to investigate the case .
&quot; the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , entered a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i in the Olympic Village . &quot;
this was reported by the team leader Ken@@ ias from the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to strain their own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man shared . &quot;
&quot; depending on the outcome of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will assess an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , released and signed , &quot; said Kenya &apos;s chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for training checks of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing in 2015 more than 800 meters .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich had been with@@ drawn from the Rio Games .
he should be informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money payments of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he report@@ edly had been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya is already under special scrut@@ iny during IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing links .
&quot; in the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before summer in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with WA@@ DA &apos;s rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar study in Kenya , as he hired in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could be proven that in this sport , nationwide and systematically ged@@ opt was performed . &quot;
Russian athletes were ther@@ eup@@ on excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm &quot; , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays a older Maria . &quot;
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly to her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character , whom I as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is highly top@@ ical : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , back then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family , shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved to go into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other ma@@ ids from East London entered an airplane to Turkey and subsequently enter a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she has married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a wi@@ dow in a few months .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in case of an electoral victory in Gar@@ land . &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects to choose Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have talked with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said the Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he also stated , Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency . &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants to be a nu@@ di@@ cal@@ ist for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Belle@@ mere to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked humans they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar .
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the view that it does the Calendar . &quot;
&quot; we must return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classical nude in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the Cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at an open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community comp@@ utes with mass ev@@ asion
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community Germany reck@@ ons on short notice with tens of thousands of people seeking asylum from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard prec@@ urs@@ or of Turkish president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the attempted coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight against minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already covered Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the put@@ sch , there were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
thus Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the President demanded that the federal government is positioned &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding of mark as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sa@@ w@@ arks , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks set before the coup the largest group of asylum authority recognized for political persecution in Germany . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , these 11,@@ 386 people and nearly 29 per cent of all applicants have been entitled to asylum ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey we do not pay homage to war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum enti@@ t@@ lement to the Basic Law are purely political , i.e. from government side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; more stupid than so far , it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land ground combat - bit@@ ing itself . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced of the candidates are on vacation .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no natives , so you are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , the plac@@ ards hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and score votes in the end , only to apply lab@@ ori@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and the last resort , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to make an election campaign almost over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition @-@ st@@ ables .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distributing ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create this &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when making the right place at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to attend major events ; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U does not wai@@ ve the usual election campaigns at market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , so co@@ co@@ co@@ eds , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country , you would be br@@ ittle at the base that it must be very strict , to find a wire again to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ ses of the country there is hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; the advice of the CD@@ U elec@@ torate , Kok@@ ert to his comrades , is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : thorns , Golden mar@@ riages , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is on the game , cel@@ ery has now called to an especially dedicated campaign . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should create the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of holiday @-@ need , and place their campaign extensively on the internet . &quot;
&quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; is called the Gover@@ ning of Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green bal@@ ers embar@@ k on track search for local vocal ch@@ ests among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from block@@ ages
&quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work starting at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end at about 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty sh@@ aky , &quot; said El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , the construction site could be moved to the south as planned , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the remun@@ eration of those responsible for construction work is also commen@@ sur@@ ate , for example when it comes to the establishment of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft journeys . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been abol@@ ished , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is restored , the traffic situation within the village has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asi@@ ve traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were in some cases considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the deputy head office manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many ble@@ aches sought and more familiar with their nav@@ i as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that many lor@@ ries in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ised .
&quot; as the speed limits were not adher@@ ed to , the municipality increased the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself on the spot on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have been fl@@ ashed .
the fastest was on the way with 77 km kilometers in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , it has become more cal@@ mer . &quot;
for business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales breaks down to them , lets anyone look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight drop , &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; the mil@@ eage is absent . &quot; &quot;
the most heavily traff@@ ick@@ ed are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; hit it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the road restoration has thrown his farm &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss the half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt asked for a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the reference , the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now they also need to bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation . &quot;
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER white from other districts where so much more generous is handled .
&quot; for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests can now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; that his master @-@ client@@ ele comes back after the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , that is brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being applied to laws . &quot;
&quot; following the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a large security package . &quot;
but what does it have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals were &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Interior Minister in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; other , out@@ going points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in that . &quot;
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was involved in results and at a &quot; realis@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , p@@ aired , that a new security agency should take care of the squ@@ ad of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons rights .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to pun@@ ish sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and also demanding nothing , which in case of coalition partners does not have any chances . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de May@@ zi@@ ère as well .
&quot; they have , in part , in themselves : he plans quick actions for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation . &quot;
&quot; refugees , who are targeted at the country , should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; for asylum seek@@ ers for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than until now - about those who commit crimes or disc@@ ard their papers in order to obsc@@ ure their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some of them are still un@@ plug@@ ged and questions can be answered .
&quot; and with some points , in the un@@ equal treatment of pati@@ ently for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be argued that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; and things that were deeply occupied by people , could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enorm@@ ously put into focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Union and the SPD are increasingly gaining in position on the topic of internal security . &quot;
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ chy argument over the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister of Interior , in which the chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also lab@@ ori@@ zes for con@@ cili@@ atory notes .
&quot; from a revers@@ al from the double @-@ pass , he does not hold anything . &quot;
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
to re @-@ open it is not useful .
&quot; and at a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional at all angles , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must still show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in it that could cause stri@@ fe .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly signals conversation and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming by .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running around .
in the recall campaign there is vort@@ ex about a term .
Volkswagen starts shipments in shipments in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite the diesel boom , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can further demonstrate a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the brand , VW , weak@@ ened particularly in Western Europe , and thus again loaded the total sales , as the company recorded in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year level . &quot;
&quot; in the home market , Germany bag@@ ged the deliveries by almost a sixth . &quot;
market sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann under@@ took the weaker figures from July mainly due to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there have been a reluc@@ tance to purchase a department in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation relating to the attempted coup in Turkey , the British vote on exit from the EU also explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the ab@@ at@@ ement first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus for be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , group sales of Fred Kap@@ pler went on to show sales plans . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the upgrade , VW confirmed that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting of vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not make any deteri@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer ref@@ uses a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not talk about a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; , &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reason to be legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now offering its German customers a guarantee for revers@@ ed diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; stated Bundes@@ verkehrs@@ ministers Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting , no deterior@@ ations will take place and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was named in corporate travel .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarant@@ y , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after the conversion , Volkswagen is able to come back to a workshop for example - and this can be trac@@ ed back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties from rich savings in future - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million Euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or d@@ ash@@ less accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see any signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; would not have to fear for its austerity policies . &quot;
&quot; store banks cash over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee will charge the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposits or cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; he has been jumping 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle he now for@@ warded the costs .
&quot; letting the cash simply lie in the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the con@@ federation of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot;
&quot; you alone bear , be &quot; business @-@ economically not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million Euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ - and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 had made head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay tax on deposits for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a little more luxuri@@ ant by fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if it bew@@ are of free money . &quot;
&quot; the G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no other banks are known to the Co @-@ Co@@ operative Association , which comp@@ utes a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative with private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it is threatening the migration of investors to compete . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
fond of middle aged men love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section to cut it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ man@@ ian man &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lied re @-@ emergence of vinyl records cannot be attributed to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
it is also not a hormone by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and wil@@ dly stu@@ ffed before I stop , hold my hands and something determining what : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic sheet speci@@ als . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , suffer the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when she appeared and sold items he sold when he was young and ready . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are promp@@ ting to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually emp@@ tied their collection so around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom in followers of the plate @-@ revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to see that record shops offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar vinyl records , from objects that evo@@ ke happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possessing material poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is for me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to engage spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % possessed a record player , whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while walking through a stack of bos@@ sa nova clusters . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put it into a shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a large percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more produ@@ ci@@ ble , less music @-@ centric . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who are slowly coming in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , dedicated to the records of almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ uses from the speakers , it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a man@@ nequ@@ in than a shopping .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting sheets is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to print the jeans styles , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley Record Player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argue that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , selling hair@@ dressing services or to sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which hold a fire and health risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also assumed that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp which is run in charity and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that closure was &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants went on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the course of the summer . &quot;
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of velocity meters : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new fl@@ ashes are tested , the tem@@ pos should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ looking En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for accident @-@ related areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ate bridges with temporary tem@@ per , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : his battery lasts five days , while the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as directions to time , strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be fitted with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; in order that it is not easy to use , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear in a safe outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ender against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer according to specifications of Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various federal states and meanwhile also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain reco@@ vers silver in 7 @-@ pack Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins gold
the impressive performance of Britain &apos;s 7 @-@ year @-@ old rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium .
&quot; Fi@@ ji made a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , back@@ rest , line run and raw power to win gold - their first olymp@@ ic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji had a 15 @-@ man @-@ team at this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they only lost one .
&quot; this folder will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks blast the GB@@ s out of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co . , as if you were running in driving buses . &quot;
&quot; with only four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a rag@@ ing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute Ath@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua gets a touch @-@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
&quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u , by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med until the line to make a gate . &quot;
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still st@@ oned . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB carried out fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half , until Joshua passed through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the South sea sul@@ p@@ ans , whose fans che@@ ered and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and GB kick@@ ed sm@@ ashed in the grass . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als at 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more remote gold than with these games and that will mean something .
&quot; from the first ru@@ ff to the last , 220 tough h@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she ru@@ ined the first women in the history of British sport , which made such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , her 39.@@ ter un@@ beaten work , which is also exemplary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress which make the difference , and there was no one more stern@@ ly than the coach who was not aware of whether he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and they did .
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right concept at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , her first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nervous morning preparing something more than usual , trying to handle his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much it means to me , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something mad@@ ness .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time out for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , with your own Steve Back@@ ground TV adventure . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; the managing director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small Francon@@ ian drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was called the original sound in a contribution of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Francon@@ ia dig@@ ged the co@@ er@@ ick association .
the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exemplary .
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Emplo@@ ye@@ e Association , of which 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the congregations are Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water delivery contracts for other towns and communities .
&quot; the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn Wid@@ ma@@ yer Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a Wasser@@ man in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched out from the water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , real estate purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the floo@@ ds ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ modelling of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always taken up new additions , because water is the most important food for life and drinking water . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised Go@@ ll@@ ers faith@@ fully , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has set himself up with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association in a real way as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Francon@@ ia water forum . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water attend@@ ant and he was a faithful ch@@ ap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on 3rd January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

&quot; when the disease had been known by her son , she believed that she ought to die . &quot;
but the eight year old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn privately in New York where it is the best therap@@ ist .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man killed in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday and killed them deadly .
&quot; the man called himself among us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is fle@@ eing , according to him will be publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
but it is a couple of years old .
&quot; in the meantime , the man bears a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot;
&quot; if you see Sven S. , the 110 will call . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the police in Lübeck intended to make no information about the crime or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime fiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Flas@@ h@@ back for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens which threatened the industry from green mining depend on the table .
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition from existing systems to the so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that after two years we could finally reach our tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission initially planned to use the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a certificate agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the ste@@ el@@ works , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent is needed . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulations is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; Steel to the Future &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of emissions trading schemes , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy , as the world &apos;s largest producer of gro@@ wers China cast mass steel to the world market in view of the s@@ lugg@@ ish domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers are dump@@ ing price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , hands @-@ on import duties show an import @-@ steel effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
un@@ clear is how sustain@@ ably the price pick up is .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at the end Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the last@@ ings of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , such as Steel Business Development . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the crowd went back for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : sing Do Sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp about her entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in teacher &apos;s studies , she occupied the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good about her health and her spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the Deutsche Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to arrange and organize yourself , be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
for doing so senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly demands his lungs , is not as fast as the Pu@@ ste in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority ; it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , it explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs awak@@ ens many memories in older people , often linked with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia @-@ infected people are sin@@ king into long @-@ flying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , a special performance is required to the head , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
&quot; even older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem increases by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I go for something long for something , I become better and more alert over me - this experience rein@@ forces . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in the search for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior &apos;s choir , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the internet .
&quot; those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with internet research . &quot;
&quot; he who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that &apos;s true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the plu@@ cking of cat babies on adult animals has .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also caused the males to not get cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ str@@ ating of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens , who find themselves in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary School and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
k@@ aters also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens is different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were pre @-@ played for a cri@@ b of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers consider their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the driver when this calls played the very er@@ reg@@ ated k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be alleged or develop with sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby @-@ no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were mothers already or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r was issued an arrest warrant against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , a major football match will be held in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said . &quot;
&quot; even when the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the emergency state after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of ordinary citizens should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
even before football hasn &apos;t been stopped .
&quot; against the former St@@ ark@@ ett Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ d , the Prosecutor made an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , chairman of the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , is said to be responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; although the state of exception is still valid for 90 days until October , indeed , this does not affect the life of most Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places throughout the country have declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
sports is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in view of dramatic experiences in the history of the Turks , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; in case of a cup winner &quot; &quot; Gala , &quot; &quot; it will be especially possible to arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , Cologne presented his sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the final play against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 victory hit .
the paper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy of his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League .
in the south of Li@@ g it only reached rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to gain something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we have done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal buff@@ ers as Sü@@ ß @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ schl@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the attempted coup attempt at the AC Florence had not been announced after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this , the Stür@@ mer would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of its estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; his salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals chance at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has already been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .

Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who compl@@ ained shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was kick@@ ed out and rested at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a bizarre scene : with a smiling smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her show . &quot;
&quot; when she was arrested , she did not get gold , the audience broke out in a storm @-@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men who , despite D@@ oping past , go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is considered as the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Championships of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 have been positively tested on the banned stimul@@ ant drug Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ toxic@@ ation and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 and has been locked for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means for penis enlargement has been responsible , denied Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an ) : hardly any athletes have been detected afterwards . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after it was established by him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silber 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ Title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the also recognized bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was due to a judgement of the international sports court in CAS .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world pupp@@ et@@ eer and gol@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin had only been tested in May but still can start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell out and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ ent@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left this . &quot;
they planned their journey home for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as t@@ ul@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , were initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai army was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning there were again two explo@@ sives , but a further human being was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a city . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower shop , the spr@@ inkl@@ er had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ vier of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast , demanded several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same manuscript , &quot; said K@@ rit@@ om@@ av@@ ee Military Tribunal for Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives , but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not be related to the Islam@@ ist movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence of im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; it was still un@@ clear , which group was sitting behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police force their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the mine explo@@ sions , the Austrian State Department recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot;
after disputes between the security forces and the Muslim populations there is no need to travel to these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to p@@ ave chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody disturb@@ ances , keeps itself in good position to restore the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the rebel revol@@ t of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; nearly one year ago , in Bangkok , a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine had been killed twenty people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is advised in the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several country offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identi@@ fiable movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said constitutional director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
thus immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East become diff@@ use in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we now observe the movement .
the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that have been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identical . &quot; &quot;
&quot; during the decision , Ma@@ arten said , his authority was closely coordinated with the local offices . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda is supposed to address the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , from several German federal states , reports on contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; have been given to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he did not know any evidence . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such people have influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ sia said he would not talk about new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be law @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that further legal @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of law @-@ terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed concern that many ass@@ aults proce@@ eded to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in case of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated perpetr@@ ators or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many individuals have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , but then radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympics or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race in 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start@@ right from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; because in Ethiopia , most sport@@ s@@ men run , Hab@@ it just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred him as &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made it funny with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to play alone in a run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ en@@ etic , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired back then . &quot;
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the threatening election defeat not so tight
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking about a campaign in Florida .
&quot; should it be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already got an alternative video . &quot;
he then dri@@ fts into the holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump won the US presidential elections in November , it would not matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday &quot; , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach the end for political correctness in the end , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; in the event of an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , par@@ ted the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade its data to a counter@@ f@@ eit truck , which was partly on the counter @-@ road . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right off the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ person told the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not confi@@ dently leave the bus , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade released the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance trucks and a emergency medical car came to the accident scene at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of sewage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ding@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of until now 2.10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.8 euro ( up to now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage charges will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an excessive calculation , the waste @-@ water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach Land@@ rats@@ amt , Kul@@ mb@@ ach was established that under@@ cover these wast@@ ewater facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants on a cost @-@ top basis . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises of Wel@@ ding@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Head of Management Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calendar period may be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt thus founded the engraving of all three sewage plants with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , wast@@ ewater volumes are slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calculation period of all three systems , not least due to their age renovation and repair expendi@@ tures were incurred in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ ding@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ewater plant .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station Wel@@ ding@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and after almost 20 years operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed and an additional ventilation capability will be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses came the continual assistance and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the low wast@@ ewater treatment the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully integrated in the three systems .
&quot; in the process , Schmidt continued to have spar@@ ed the market community of great entertainment costs for wast@@ ewater treatment plants over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned systems will remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since one cannot expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal sanitary ware association in order to not be able to expand these facilities because these facilities are sanitary facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded . &quot;
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 amounted to -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as an Asian cartoon
&quot; Snap@@ chat tells that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ clear , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps arrive to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have critici@@ zed their accus@@ ation that the app Black@@ face would promote or promote white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slots , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow vision . &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity of diversity .
&quot; the messages and the indign@@ ation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et on the photos became widely used that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful &quot; and the least unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not safe , but that the yellow face was pulled into the ab@@ used extrem@@ ity . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural drift .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in terms of race as their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for media , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said , she believes that rac@@ ist controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the control practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said Chinese US Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say what about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a staff responsible for inter@@ acting ethnic groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will shut down her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership frau@@ dul@@ ent IS@@ IS intelligence services , establishes Con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al Committee &quot;
&quot; in order to draw up an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , a committee of inquiry held in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican Members of the Ar@@ med Forces , Intelligence Committ@@ ees and the Defence Committee , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , typically sent from top @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; introduced Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government officials under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic state . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , repub@@ lican representative of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they had been admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge during the investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com Reports are underway by the Secretary of Defense of the Department of Defense . &quot;
the Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely constra@@ ined process for the creation of intelligence reports on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; said the highest @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged mor@@ ale among analysts and &quot; gave over@@ ly little room for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported on the Pentagon &apos;s Chief In@@ spec@@ tor who were survey@@ ed by Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the Secret Soci@@ eties on the Islamic State reminds of dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , saw only a small occupation forces in Iraq and little time on it to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team stated that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s dam , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature owing to his exc@@ essi@@ vely positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead &quot;
&quot; one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
but she knows : the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each . &quot;
the first place will take a little longer for the strong Dutch men to lead the other group .
&quot; whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whir@@ l@@ wind through their success story four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , for the first time with three years playing a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things for better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ station in London that we now have .
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the go@@ ings in the first half of the game with a flash@@ back from the clos@@ eup .
&quot; India was in the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team showed a surprisingly tough time and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball above the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and pl@@ ou@@ ted the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel durable and inevitable , a rapid relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting queue in the coff@@ e@@ eshop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s warm with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names that were sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well @-@ being TV commerci@@ als when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner , or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade there are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I should have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many that I had questioned were not aware that there was at all an Olympic site . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and had had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on a trampoline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending coll@@ ision - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ astic and diving , the two sports that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means a spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; rising conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before landing on their feet . &quot;
&quot; you will be judged according to the official Olympic program after execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest to go gold further , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes round and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; it not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but in the television transmission also another height goal : that of the world or the Olympia bay . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is noble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ acker and the objective rating of male athletes - as the male US tur@@ ner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ ting , new fans . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testi@@ fied that sixty protest@@ ors were killed during coll@@ isions with police in gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and wi@@ dened into ever more areas .
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was un@@ rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses testi@@ fied that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security men hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN authority on human rights now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed , or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ eh@@ old in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after an extensive criticism of last year , the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are increasing ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts argue that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the national liberation front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can use tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess tend to explo@@ de after years of hypo@@ cris@@ y under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does not lock access to Facebook and Twitter what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians thank@@ ed that they were so much prot@@ esting .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as prosp@@ ered predominantly Christian high @-@ nation@@ als from Ethiopia , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well @-@ vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region North of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to analysts apparently ple@@ dged by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of disturb@@ ances went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal confusion of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ ist city , run by Tig@@ ray and hatred of the Tig@@ ray become more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ en@@ ic flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to clearly support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his statement Obama was founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to scatter the last controversy that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades , who endeav@@ our to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , to explain statements which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump with@@ drew in reference to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism rus@@ hed down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but he later explained &quot; &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed a more pronounced tone , because his demand values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a great lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze brought his loyal comrades into the un@@ comfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent representatives , gave great effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it but@@ ler , completely false , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread it by subj@@ ecting the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going round on each of his words and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he scor@@ ned the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps excuse as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; supp@@ ressed at the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only bar that no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years serving good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices exp@@ elled from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replacing Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people ro@@ amed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is also a re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated gallery opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has wi@@ fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered to provide money for a new out@@ source , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so bottle model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and s@@ lic@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are tear@@ proof keys .
&quot; the café does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the Ver@@ b closed , she gave a while to coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before work and became inevitably always the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing b@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing b@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap shop took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in the coffee shop as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café , too . &quot;
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he prepared to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
a new version is enough for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the presence of the restaurant and the ordering of a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ tur@@ tle Sou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; its menu on this day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es latest book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , medium @-@ sized snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock crash 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Bow@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh bowl with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable blend . &quot;
&quot; as the repor@@ ter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut @-@ bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper , which stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; sets out the ways in which the country was moving to no longer be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e s@@ led why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and sau@@ c@@ ers became stap@@ le foods that could re@@ wind c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful species , eating lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ able ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar mix@@ tures were tested , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing gr@@ ati@@ fication had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen @-@ sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes prescri@@ ptions , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lun@@ ch@@ time , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the house business recipes .
&quot; as never before , or ever since , drive bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by announ@@ cing prescri@@ ptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping women &quot; and to meet the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treat . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , like president Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ meal @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly lau@@ ded the simple I@@ owa peasant @-@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he appe@@ aled as the milli@@ on@@ ous man of the world to whom he had become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and held a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ fic to reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , a house@@ keeper had no interest in flavors due to Mrs. Roosev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was disc@@ ar@@ ded as soon as the country came back on its feet .
&quot; the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of w@@ asting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e mar@@ ched out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt had to lunch . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said , and added that it was a normal trick to miss a fancy name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon into the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a stroke .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set up his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civilian protection group , who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people alive . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life in the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses , and to make first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil protection that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans the lumin@@ ous symbol@@ figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said loud , &quot; &quot; For me this is the true ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrels over the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from difficulty breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children are playing with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland @-@ hai : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the ship ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland is only 150 years old .
&quot; the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k is flo@@ ored at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches just 1.@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , however , seems to be a fool@@ ish@@ ness for a high age . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science in any case from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist thought for a long time that Greenland will become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only l@@ acked the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ h@@ arks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in winter at the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
&quot; their slow @-@ motion @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ons , when they carried out six animals with a transmitter in front of the S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; loo@@ t make this shar@@ k nonetheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for car@@ c@@ asses that tor@@ to@@ ise from higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ sh@@ arks looking for fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest cm cm measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the len@@ tic@@ ular nucleus of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins in it are later no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks were notably carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ ular core .
&quot; therefore , after the early 1960s , her birth was supposed to be as an atomic weapon for large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the len@@ tic@@ ular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens @-@ core , that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could associate an old age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the current record holder , an 211 year old Greenland v@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip was caught , was captured in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ parag@@ us . &quot;
so they attack later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more danger@@ ously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life . &quot;

&quot; with topics relating to building , the municipal council has focused primarily on the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board accepted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for survey@@ ing could be clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion phase 1 ) is no longer in the way to interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au address young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors equally .
&quot; as it was said , construction workers can announce themselves immediately in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to discuss the gran@@ ting of the par@@ c@@ els in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also en@@ force requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land registration plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
in the area Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n the trading area is wi@@ dened by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; therefore , the city of the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks continue to operate from financial stores across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been approved in the UK . &quot;
that is where big US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
Baker &amp; Mc@@ K@@ enz@@ ie Firm of the Year for Banking and Finance
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , and other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk policy . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg possesses a large fund industry , but also cuts down Dublin &apos;s infrastructure in terms of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city boasts easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;

Gilead wins legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; an American court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs , which you have ar@@ isen from the hep@@ ati@@ te C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was freed of a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ by@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ egg and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; in lifting the complaint on Thursday , US official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to take charge of the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took over each other and claimed property for laboratory work that covered sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
troops backed by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the United States supported the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ CS ) , according to the Ex@@ odus of the still remaining group of fighters , who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they released more than 2,000 civilians , which were held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared shared Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reuters with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are running out clearing operations , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published their tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term of office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s Can@@ didate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declaration of the past decade together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective German VAT rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and reluc@@ tance with regards to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not obliged to do so . &quot;

&quot; on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions were not finished . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tic , among other things , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already expressed his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already top@@ pled the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump calling to publish his tax declaration .
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a New York Times business journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors , stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
the federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during last week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka challenged buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat , Tr@@ ump to discuss their tax declarations . &quot;
he said that he had been subjected to a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump has &quot; fear &quot; in front of the elec@@ torate and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ tons campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , have an average annual tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that only USD 100 per share was pay@@ able , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , out of which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , intensi@@ fied its promotion along with US conservation efforts to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is a World Health Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ...

Jewish director dis@@ rup@@ ts Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media tower after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli selection , as Arab guests had requested a &quot; &quot; staff &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the country &apos;s electoral list .
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; what happened in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the New Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call centre . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dism@@ issed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this in Germany has brought itself in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some were subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there had been the alleged appeal of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly instruc@@ ted all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear@@ gas &amp; gum@@ shield against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students came together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they assembled to protest against the government reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rub@@ bers against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , when police officers were trying to disper@@ se the students , which meant that the police put rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor of São Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters were seen to spray Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended pres@@ i@@ ding Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been suspended from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade exchange between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian businesses grew strongly in the country , shared the ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an said . &quot;
he noted that the trade exchange between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation received approximately 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , affecting the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia of the last year are broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hoped that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; under the maintenance of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed persons , who had mu@@ til@@ ated their faces , fled from the staff of the drink market the release of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW @-@ golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police will not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 m , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and badly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators must follow the crossing towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , and had to flee from the gravel parking place located opposite the park entrance , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;

Nag@@ old : fun and fun during the summer break
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational daily group / social group work of the children &apos;s welfare organization Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet &quot; &quot; Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle &quot; , &quot; the life @-@ joyful group was accommod@@ ated during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to Bret@@ ten with a visit to the zoo . &quot;
&quot; to the other to M@@ ole , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jumping , swimming and pl@@ ou@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared cour@@ te@@ es such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones were made or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of departure , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ stries of the minister @-@ care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were overcome . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Romantic journey of all mini@@ stries in two years , the round of minist@@ erial round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one decided finally for the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Merc@@ y , a special pilgri@@ m destination was offered during the Holy Year of Merc@@ y . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern , were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before the pastor , Pri@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and distributed the Pil@@ gri@@ m Cross . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster young lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field@@ cru@@ ises , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made a song to sing together a song from a specially arranged pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
for the nights there were parish halls of the local par@@ ishes available .
&quot; at the stages , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went through Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that , one stepped on the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but at the same time , they had to get off at about 500 metres in high heat and then again be heard again . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a shared barbecue on the beach in the evening .
after the morning pul@@ ses on the fourth pilgri@@ m day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; clearly facilit@@ ated and happy , the min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse here God was given thanks .
&quot; in the evening mass in Münster , the min@@ is approached by Co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed . &quot;
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med at home , as Br@@ ite Gold scored for cycling &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ves last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself . &quot;
&quot; four years ago England claimed a shock@@ ing victory , while Ho@@ y got the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they held in March at the World Championships in London in spite of the back Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the gravel that has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner scored a Olympic ord in the qualification laps , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , with the passing in a higher gear , in order to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the 2012 triumph at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ des stated that after a weak start he inten@@ tionally dropped onto the track . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team during the last three months .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
this is the case of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified for the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers . &quot;
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 . &quot;
&quot; world Record , which won Gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; yesterday , he fought with representatives before the qualification , calling him officials to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s contest , which will continue and end tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team relies on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a string of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background , the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton played in the middle of sex and mop@@ ed alleg@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy demand
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , such as delivering energy companies . &quot;
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year to grant no further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting rate consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Mel@@ ting , which resulted in a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea Power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melting shop with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through melting &quot; , &quot; the Company informed . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which would have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month cancellation period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L recei@@ pts from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it has already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure power to melt &quot; does not interfere . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; referring to the analy@@ st &apos;s statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land had some 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and a total of around 900 MW of electricity per year . &quot;
should both plants disappear from the market this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and went to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this verse brought me to cry , &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( except the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; that represents the c@@ lich@@ y off@@ ense almost every birthday present of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought you had forgotten ? &quot; &quot; with hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a Senate at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate in this public@@ ity somehow . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is rather similar to a picture book than a fashion magazine , the issue pul@@ ls a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista of the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zer 6@@ 15 pages ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ star is expected to be so long @-@ awa@@ ited that in the last two years the magazine will still se@@ ep ahead of the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
in recent years more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; are on the cover .
&quot; Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs J@@ enner is described as the &quot; &quot; Durch@@ bruch@@ id &quot; &quot; of her generation - under the former category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything is based on common denom@@ in@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s success does not like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always excited about the world of fashion . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the mi@@ sts of the moment . &quot;
&quot; these feelings boil up again , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover . &quot;
but to move around on the mis@@ m seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is to be seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centres in@@ struct 16@@ 0,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid figur@@ ines are rejected annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry anticip@@ ates the impact of other aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and the like - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ law@@ ed , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of the community centres of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of Co@@ operations Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people already had to be rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without lifting the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we are calling for the General Prosecutor and Federal Adjust@@ ment Minister as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately remove these abbrevi@@ ations , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
it is now time to view the needs of community centers and their customers and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Elec@@ ted campaign accused of having claimed arms
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action , having been told that their campaign manager for North Carolina acted as a fire@@ arm for a staff in February , while in February they were in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in a indictment , handed down on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
Bord@@ ini had waited for months to have maintained that the matter would be set up internally before realis@@ ing that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the Camp@@ agn@@ ist , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ran the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini handed over to his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini concluded that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; Bord@@ ini added . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation ensu@@ es only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate got an u@@ pro@@ ar when he said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owner and weapon @-@ friends - should take action if his ri@@ val was elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn away his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
&quot; B@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint demands damages from the campaign for violation of duty of care , and of Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental damage . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip just failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; phone calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before federal elections : the SPD and the CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are characterized . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in representative surveys by the research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey results in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD declined from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 per cent more than five years ago . &quot;

Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market . &quot;
the successor still domin@@ ates the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which today would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros enthusiasts can buy devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months ago at the C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator could be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , though very slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 euro . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile branch of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and wound to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market domin@@ ates providers who all came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphones in the world . &quot;
&quot; sold were about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple sold alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around € 400 billion .
&quot; in addition , the well @-@ running shops of the countless apps providers and the telec@@ oms companies are coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only in early 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al proc@@ ession began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the watch . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ Berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to put the smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of extension He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we &apos;ll be bl@@ aming at the world stage .
the two fl@@ yers had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked .
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented run@@ ways of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games in 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as to secure our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempt to circum@@ vent advertising block , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lo@@ osen on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertisement in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the enco@@ ding on his advertisements to make it difficult to detect which part of the page advertising is to be difficult to complain . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams said that &quot; this kind of hold @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the anti @-@ present@@ ational open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying sign@@ makers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study conducted last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times so much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertis@@ ment accounts for 84 percent of its advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has set it to desktop PCs on desktop PCs , because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a large amount of revenue , so Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; advertisement prize pool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be al@@ ar@@ ming new filters because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control over the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with susp@@ ects suicide on the Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police calls on witnesses after a woman died in the early morning hours on Thursday with suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of V@@ aud right after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 years , who was transferred from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police that promp@@ ted these as well as every witness of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigating procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter dem Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was there a coll@@ ision inevitable ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers are not held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which one person was driving in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian prec@@ edes in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of neg@@ ligent killing after crossing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become un@@ conscious on the street , the Court rejected . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who answered an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have recorded similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere , and yet it slowly turned further . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic versatility to host lives and protected from fast ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS Scienti@@ st Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a rain umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected of planetary researchers .
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gene , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide escap@@ es with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to minor co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed that decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I have thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded as the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in any of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two tracks with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; nor@@ the@@ ee@@ pers take up talks , strike strikes &quot;
&quot; the work struggles for the remun@@ eration for North sea workers are suspended , while all the parties for a new round of discussion sit at the table , said Neg@@ oti@@ ator . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea conducted by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the stri@@ pping process of the present strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start early next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has reduced the rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s short@@ ening follows a 10 % decline in on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company give the needed room to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a consequence of its meg@@ a union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which has intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ es@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star @-@ rise of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ run rotate to different rates , as well as in what context the rotary periods are related to planetary development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars of stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the galax@@ y of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star hotel , built around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
you are now getting the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these str@@ apping stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star aging , its rotation rate starts to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by det@@ ecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates shows that more massive stars tend to turn slower than less massive stars .
&quot; hull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slow down pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the galax@@ y of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older ones , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more , like how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang out their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees on 12 August against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , &quot; &quot; the 14 @-@ year @-@ old All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) explained . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez spent long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 counts for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle sailors ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the Hall of Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - Nick@@ name &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - in the field was , so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days do not run smoothly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legend has once again received the big stage in their last matches , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a goodbye @-@ tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Y@@ ank@@ ees Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy for fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ ri@@ val Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive d@@ ope probe , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio are not allowed to start . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le steep@@ le in Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - directly before the start of the critically endangered athle@@ tics competitions this news comes to the accident . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a m@@ ating agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International sport court CAS confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the fin@@ als over 100 m butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the ball@@ ads more than 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
chen has applied for the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association assumes the matter &quot; very seriously and requires Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation in the investigation , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Tribunal for CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history no more the IO@@ C but the CAS for the san@@ ction of sport@@ s@@ men is in charge of positive cases .
&quot; also during the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an unbelievable shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly addressed the ath@@ lete &apos;s criticism .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for instance , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both are advised to take the dose , both of them may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation of IA@@ AF prohibited the whole Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , but Kenya &apos;s L@@ umin@@ fer@@ nation produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in swimming @-@ sports , the earlier off@@ ences in China caused violent con@@ front@@ ations also among athletes . &quot;
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun was the focus of an argument with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Sun was positively tested by the Chinese nation@@ als on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Daten@@ kl@@ au : how per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ ress h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware currently targeted businesses - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware Defense Speci@@ alist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in attacks in corporate networks according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ e@@ ytes . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to inv@@ ent ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we currently observe a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malicious software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the offen@@ ders discovered the black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred rapidly in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as to archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and cle@@ ars the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ id Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to inter@@ rupt business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute acute by the loss of ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only fund the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation in operation . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ackers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ outs and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to make more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrifices by chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , establish freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t example files for nothing . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partially negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , h@@ ackers become more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ boards .
&quot; the so @-@ called malware @-@ kits have been created by the malware , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says . &quot;
the black@@ boards then look for more h@@ ackers in order to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one log@@ ically logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and mand@@ ates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals will commission the sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 % of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful assessment , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could in future take completely new targets on the Internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat controlled by the internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the release of such a block@@ aded heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only a small size of 1.@@ 60 metres , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work tight at any point . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit top falls out there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a boot of 45@@ 3 l available for up@@ loading and 10@@ 26 l with up@@ swing back@@ rests , but there are the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin @-@ chairs and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the average daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the tested top variant , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems belong to the City emergency braking system ( operates at speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assistance assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when sh@@ un@@ ting , he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent temp@@ or@@ eg@@ ler respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle if necessary the speed .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI female are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest as much will receive the petrol from 20,000 euros , diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
Honda has a versatile and everyday vehicle with the HR @-@ V .
Air@@ line is not liable : crash on passenger jet@@ rack
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
&quot; for a liability is conceivable only in haz@@ ards that are typical of aviation , the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Köln ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap at the crash .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
&quot; after their trip , sick leave will only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests showed the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a trial , a family on the second day of their trial was severely damaged and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
&quot; her illness brought back the holiday@@ makers to a defective sewage plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water . &quot;
the family felt that the trip was flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the purification plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the event organis@@ er only briefly informed of the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the water samples .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ ran@@ ged .
&quot; at Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have taken care of further attacks . &quot;
the state had to be possessed and decided at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and split . &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if perpetr@@ ators need to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag elections .
&quot; he also announced further personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; in a medium @-@ scale magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be pun@@ is@@ hable once more .
&quot; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the last much discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be preserved in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ sed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior declared himself clearly against Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
he considers a general ban on the enforcement of the enforcement in constitutional law .
&quot; you cannot for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
one can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green Chief Simone Peter accused the minister he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els and act of action .
&quot; the left party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet of Pro@@ verbs and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the common law bring people no longer safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the fre@@ eway
it st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal remedy is to be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car @-@ rac@@ ers , who are standing in traffic on the main road every evening in traffic when they drive over the motorway t@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( August 16 / 17 ) , road construction will extend the right @-@ to @-@ turn track by 700 meters between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
drivers can then feed directly from Hammer street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early , whereby the overall procedure is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the train track on the Zu@@ br@@ inger anno@@ ys the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ yard extends to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ fjord and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is guided only one lane above the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back almost three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy load traffic with two lanes . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated labour @-@ day traffic will continue , the competent state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mode can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to be expected , the bridge has an official remaining usable period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal reserve , the Landes@@ betrieb deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities there is to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule has visited the theater piece &quot; The invisible home . &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association provides young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Forest School Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible home &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the youth of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from language , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background should have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theat@@ rical play and theat@@ rical language education are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee figures , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope on weather improvement
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we surely see many stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ters are per@@ sei@@ ls , which are one of the fastest star@@ ters with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , that rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you can walk around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the mor@@ nings there is no more to think of sleep in the morning before the wake of the alarm bells . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes can be attributed to them , &quot; says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eping , member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Schla@@ ef@@ or@@ em and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a one in and through @-@ sleep disorder . &quot;
&quot; just the sleeping sense many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagner @-@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Home@@ Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs can be put into place . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is often frequent in depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ nia case , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should sleep disturb@@ ances go to the doctor ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es we@@ aken . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look very different : one is tired , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; there are hardly any sleep medical practitioners in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary bed @-@ care centre of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of in@@ som@@ nia , one should first turn to the family doctor , advis@@ es we@@ ther . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory dro@@ pl@@ ers , in case of illness or if you do not find the cause of in@@ som@@ nia , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after c@@ apping you go to bed at its normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al mask , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera draws the sleeping place on the ceiling . &quot;
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of screws , where you can sleep for better sleep . &quot;
&quot; we@@ eping is counting on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol avoid and at night don &apos;t look at the watch - then you start to reck@@ on instantly , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to have with missing medals in swimming
the former German fisher@@ man Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first took gold at the Doh@@ a short @-@ track champ@@ ionships and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ colleagues in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ colleagues . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0.000 € should no one be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the subsi@@ dy system in swimming is bad , however , dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how it should be kept in countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : ban@@ de from Bag@@ gage
Du@@ essel@@ dorf airport - Du@@ essel@@ dorf

the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and baggage theft charges as a gang .
&quot; at 9.@@ 30 pm civilian officers in the area of Düsseldorf airport caught a gang , known as polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ici@@ des since mid @-@ July and were in common , labour @-@ friendly and very professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Krimin@@ al@@ kom@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts , specifically for the off@@ ence of crimes in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the process , they had carried out a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem like that , but the police is one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; the article about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in , is , however , preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the inhabitants have ten@@ ants , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has spoken several times for a harsh police action against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ mi@@ ths , had been swe@@ pt away with 300 police officers , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wag@@ ons on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later police and builders rejected the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of houses in the sun , others talk about Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs three children , are especially gener@@ alised by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the building projects , they share the concerns about rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted several local police protection against the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between house owners and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which also has a low average income and a high poverty rate in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer Strasse close to the R@@ ī@@ ga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was placed under large police charge in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ads from all over the world over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on cast windows or newly painted fac@@ ades that were du@@ g with color bags .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the off@@ ences render defects , which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ement house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of in@@ security . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is crucial : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been this . &quot;
even the famous burning cars will no longer give it to the R@@ ī@@ ga .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remains .
&quot; that is why it was so important for her to get back the street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by un@@ si@@ ghted new buildings in former construction gaps , which displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well drunk &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone does not listen to it ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration in all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for breeders who are fond of color bombs : the building project and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who pre@@ fers to complain about noise there . &quot;
all persons only with first names have asked to not be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ gee Affairs Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Commissioner for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , migrant workers , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here , the Secret Woll@@ l@@ actic au , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less spot@@ less than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , has been a penet@@ r@@ ative wo@@ olen sal@@ es@@ au . &quot;
&quot; administrative work is not her central area , writes Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers will soon be available in the W@@ as@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented dormit@@ ories .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or renov@@ ating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; in fact , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work so far as you depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments need to be recovered , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are internship plac@@ ements , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and backup job for refugees and migrants that need to be rounded or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day need a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so we need special offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , administration and volunteers are also jumping . &quot;
&quot; it is central , that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever would eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , may not be able to work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problem cases , too , says the customer , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do they have fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde quite clearly , &quot; what a certain na@@ ï@@ ve name may call . &quot; a residual risk cannot and would not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these occur@@ ren@@ ces are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins brought them up completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the local and local volunteers need to look out for activities in the region . &quot;
they have always in the background that soon a new shot of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics disgu@@ ises itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it &apos;s unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine Client also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher has already been busy to integrate the previous people into a reasonable manner .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men have been forc@@ efully inv@@ aded in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday mor@@ nings at 8.@@ 50 am .
the residents surprised the two and beat the Un@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.70 m tall , probably m@@ asked , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies wore . &quot;
they fled to downtown .
&quot; in the event of flag@@ ration , the police put several strips of polic@@ emen as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the prosecution ran without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown occurred near the apartment or on their escape . &quot;
