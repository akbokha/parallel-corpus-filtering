<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their partying, they drove home to the feed troughs in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the equestrian career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he left his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also with CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite impressive.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">Awards do not lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already blamed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th Prize Winners of the Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, on Saturday, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for athletic successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has promoted the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros the same."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-fold US master-champion was inducted into the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the award-winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the jumping stallion Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handball Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trading agreements - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are in tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep the doubts small and cautions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to taxing the economy to death and regulate them to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, he himself would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will greatly regain regulations, and he makes a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to accomplish, it has disadvantages to open up and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost the same."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate declares the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical teapa wing of the Republicans strictly.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, party-internal discussions could also come."</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and reboot the coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement he wants to terminate."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, specifically wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program:" a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazier trade deal, do not want to sign them."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them want to isolate the US from international trade, but rather to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should then also be better paid, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rerce, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the large discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would only increase.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who are alone, almost everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby who is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her small son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles shortly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene acts normally.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the division manager of Condrobs, a carrier of social aid services in Bavaria, and among other things she deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are Poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the south of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs established the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - either not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hopefers to Europe," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the escape:" many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this continues."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, are irre, narrated Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters are often regarded as inferior and at worst misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experienced, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, there are more accommodations only for them, challenges Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project like in Munich, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in shelters of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, dfled women are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Lower Franconia, there are storeys or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are hosted separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or are accommodated together men and women, it may become - ongoing - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"first of all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as the women feel this need for protection, one can read on the impulse given to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has spoken around that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called their union to approve new work campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the Chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained" "persistent, quiet", "which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "considering that the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official re-negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin accepts his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile appeared dirty, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but to improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdoğan would have behaved as if nothing had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, lasting radiator showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's response at the time was raging.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the confidence will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most seriously the accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been enthroned at a failed coup d'état in almost his office last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulates it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry at the West, as its reaction to the attempted takeover of power is considered a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing resentment on the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who insists on pulling out of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian state leader gained a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d "état sought support for the elected state institutions.</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regiment."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent an" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that have driven themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both the presidents had said at the press conference that they did not even seize the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally avoided tackling a question of its differences, while Putin chose to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned institute of Moscow International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it is called (in Russian) that he later became Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Government and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your job as a head of state concerning bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works as he worked for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - pushed on great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to entrust placards for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President's administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin reached the power he called Ivanov one of five people, whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was believed that after Putin's second term, President Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term Putin's term had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally by Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the northern deck of Queensferry cross sings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blower" "that will approach each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Business Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry cross sings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering from a truly epic dimension to this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connecting between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of the total bridge decoration is at its place and the last section of the deck is getting ready for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last pavement and its connection with the north turmdeck in expansion, we had to close the gap between the north or the country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massively, since the Viadukt is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards on an ascent of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "concept of action" "at the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will have to show up 20 percent of all apartments in social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall is, as Bratmann:" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and is still to be financed should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"notwithstanding that, so Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program does not yet fully stand out: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do we compensate for the loss of other approximately 1300 affordable housing that will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 flats."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of bringing flats back to the price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"on one shot, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the west city, the year-end deadlines run out."</seg>
<seg id="28">Approximately 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, it is removed from the goal of so-called interference."</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a large majority, the CDU has to go to the boat."</seg>

<seg id="3">"in the last decade, teenagers and children do not want to go outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens, has been sued by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games and recently limited to smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on characters, initially created for video games in the 1990s (later, a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go has more user than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and, once they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>

<seg id="15">"cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, watched 35,000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of downstream users who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take" "to come from the sofa" "and" "be active every day" "came on deaf ears, because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look elingly."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sport, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonder of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are mürmetric spoils that always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, anyone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even when Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be slowed down with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie "</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present to myself in the gymnasium of the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been at each Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Katholikin, makes everybody proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflecting the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was an Afro American woman among female gymnasts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the unbelievable achievement of the triple World Championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterly Gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual campaign for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this kind of sport, but we don't see gymnastic classes in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team. moreover, that's the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but reality is such that gymnasts play a more expensive sport and gymnasts first and foremost in private gyms that are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel, competition, and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the majority of these turntables are located in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner will receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-lasting commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started exercising."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the municipalities aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible exercise."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my sports foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic clubteam and thank you, you were motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the Functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident physicians who voted for a vote rejected him."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in July, Hunt had revealed plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a" No Man Land "and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the first assistance physicians should receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve maintenance at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairperson of the BMA Committee for Assisted Physicians, stated last night in a message:" assists have made serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it will address the current workforce crisis and to administer it to meet all doctors. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors drop under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by discussions have appealed to the government for the sake of reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">"this happened to the promise that Jeremy Hunt had made it last month, that his door would always be offended."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise the vibrations and address the concerns of the resident physicians."</seg>
<seg id="10">"should he not do this, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved in granting doctors on strike postcards."</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformist Treaty with the Functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the BMA wants a better weekday remuneration for the 54,000 resident physicians who are subject to the contract."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called for the assistance physicians to end the strike."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the past two months, we spoke to the committee of the assistants and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as deployment, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training vacations and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness flourishes in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud is knowingly ignored in Muslim communities as a devastating report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, ex-member of the cabinet, attacks the police, elective observers, and town councils to disregard proofs of electoral misuse due to" oversensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and municipal government, which is now an antantical king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside elective cabins to protect favorites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should take a passport with them, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must merely name its name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removeable inks to a person's finger, when they give up their votes in order to prevent anyone choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by non official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also aims to protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlscandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year a special electoral dish decided that the current mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis of the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was particularly alarming to the fraudulent postchoice - in which older members of the Muslim community made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guidance of expulsion to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it is said:" evidence has been applied to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" intolerances concerning ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection to stop" "elections". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report submitted by Theresa May also requires tougher registration procedures, in order to avoid that the electoral list is used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on the finger of a person, as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Perform systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on applications to an automatic selection of letters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists edit full postings and envelopes of postelections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set off barriers for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change in the law which facilitated an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the repression of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographer's ban in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go to the cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric coincides with the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no punishment."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany on corrupt and illegal practices," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "abhaktions" of the voting rights of the town hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you get closer to you from behind, then you should first turn around, so that you can see your attacker and go out of the shot line," "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"hit him with his knee in the groin and twisting you while the Attacker crushes back pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and Würgereflex of a serious test - by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk crashed his train at Piccadilly Circus, a railing toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to us what it is meant to be."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to block the sink pot of a draw toilet which has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he leckled, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to rail stations to sinflushing of toilets, the task turned its immune system definitely under a rehearsal"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film, he said:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its probex line showed a luminometric speed of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak off after its luminometric speed was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" showing the bacteria count in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This comes close to the worst thing I've oiled in a toilet." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not lick anything here, because it is disgusting here inside."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">Firm of the Year for Compliance Audits and Investigations Gibson Dunn & Crutcher Firm of the Year for Corporate</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Products Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended telling us "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film direction, added:" let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had checked out some of the things I had told him, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others, in which it was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these filthy goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative was shocked by the property in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had clinging holes on, wooden boards were torn, rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was embellished to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who worked for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this estate is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikes and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old junk was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were opened."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner violently by the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogations were cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They were not afraid of anybody. "</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always terrible.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would abhor the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogation is always the last step in consideration of Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give solace to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">"housekeeping workers will now have to dig up garbage mountains, which surround the house"</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after having found a guilty verdict by the owner of a drug of class B.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the rooms of the house were embellished with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delogate tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow, by the Devon and Cornwall police, announced that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without accusations, as well as those who were damaged by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work starting at 5.30am and end at about 20 o'clock, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty shaky," said Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south as planned, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the remuneration of those responsible for construction work is also commensurate, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift journeys."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been migrated to the south on Monday and also the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been abolished, and thus the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation within the village has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were in some cases considerable discomfort," says the deputy head office manager Florian King. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many bleaches sought and more familiar with their navi as the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that many lorries in residential areas were franchised.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality increased the vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," "says King, who made himself on the spot on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 km kilometers in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has been moved, it has become more calmer."</seg>
<seg id="20">For businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breaks down to them, lets anyone look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the" end customer, "i.e. for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" most slight drop, "but also admits that" the mileage is absent. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily trafficked are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants" hit it "hard." "</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">Forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="33">"the road restoration has thrown his farm" "two years back."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss the half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt asked for a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the reference, the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now they also need to bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER white from other districts where so much more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"for all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, family business has been located here since 1715, referring to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regular guests can now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it is somewhere else beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="42">"that his master-clientele comes back after the refurbishment work, Göhner has no doubt."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long-standing history."</seg>

<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees."</seg>

<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section to cut it under the pseudonym non-Allemanian man's age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplied re-emergence of vinyl records cannot be attributed to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wildly stuffed before I stop, hold my hands and something determining what:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic sheet specials."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), suffer the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when she appeared and sold items he sold when he was young and ready."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompting to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually emptied their collection so around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs now to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom in followers of the plate-revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to see that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar vinyl records, from objects that evoke happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possessing material possessions than a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is for me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to engage spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% possessed a record player, whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while walking through a stack of bossa nova clusters."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put it into a shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more producible, less music-centric."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who are slowly coming in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the records of almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's newest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz druses from the speakers, it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannequin than a shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore collecting sheets is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is... "it drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to print the jeans styles, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley Record Player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday morning with the strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, who overlooks nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argue that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, selling hairdressing services or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which hold a fire and health risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp which is run in charity and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it meant that closure was" for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants went on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcomers over the course of the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain's 7-year-old rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit at the Deodoro Stadium with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji made a master class in handling, side-quilting, backrest, line run and raw power to win gold - their first olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was due to the not too bad consolation of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji had a 15-man-team at this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon."</seg>

<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this folder will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and let the attacks blast the GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell to and Co., as if you were running in driving buses."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with only four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he turned around."</seg>

<seg id="16">"a raging Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athjasa Veremalua gets a touch-down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>

<seg id="19">"Vatemo Ravouvou, by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed until the line to make a gate."</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still stoned."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB carried out fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijianic gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua passed through a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the South sea sulpans, whose fans cheered and danced on the tribune."</seg>

<seg id="4">"even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she ruined the first women in the history of British sport, which made such a scale."</seg>

<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant Athletins, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress which make the difference, and there was no one more sternly than the coach who was not aware of whether he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>

<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>

<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>

<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched out from the water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, the budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," "said the chairman."</seg>
<seg id="15">"as outstanding events she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountains (1994), real estate purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the floods (1999), the re-purchase of a central computer control (2004) and the remodelling of water pipes."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Flashback for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-exploited and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens which threatened the industry from green mining depend on the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the liberation of the Renewable Energy Transition from existing systems to the so-called self-production in the German steel industry," said Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition). "</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that after two years we could finally reach our tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"accordingly, the European Commission initially planned to use the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a certificate agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks, an EEG levy of 20 percent is needed."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulations is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our" "Steel to the Future" "campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others need to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of emissions trading schemes, climate and employment targets are weighed down," said IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to intensify, as the world's largest producer of growers China cast mass steel to the world market in view of the sluggish domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are dumping price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, hands-on import duties show an import-steel effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainably the price pick up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry Primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have stagnated."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the end ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the lastings of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 860,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, such as Steel Business Development."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the crowd went back for the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">The aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, Spirit, Health: sing Do Seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp about her entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in teacher's studies, she occupied the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good about her health and her spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to arrange and organize yourself, be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"who regularly demands his lungs, is not as fast as the Puste in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Citizens Organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority; it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, it explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening of songs awakens many memories in older people, often linked with positive feelings of their adolescence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-infected people are sinking into long-flying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, a special performance is required to the head, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem increases by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I go for something long for something, I become better and more alert over me - this experience reinforces."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in the search for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior's choir, one can easily connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that's true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="11">They were pre-played for a crib of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers consider their results despite the low sample for meaningful results.</seg>

<seg id="16">This ability may be alleged or develop with sexually mature.</seg>

<seg id="17">We assume that it is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives, but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Also Thai media wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not be related to the Islamist movement or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have kept secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it was still unclear, which group was sitting behind the attacks."</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the junta.</seg>

<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, will change their direction and become so extremist."</seg>

<seg id="24">But in recent years we have found that there can be law-terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that further legal-terrorism groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of law-terrorism is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">They expressed concern that many assaults proceeded to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects in case of attacks on asylum seekers were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated perpetrators or followers of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many individuals have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or elected for example, CDU, SPD or Left, but then radicalised by right-wing extremist moods."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympics or World Records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the bold appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the easily overweight swimmers from Ethiopia are so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte then became the viral internethit."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race in 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special startright from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"because in Ethiopia, most sportsmen run, Habit just wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred him as "roubles of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" "prosperity bump", "the English tabloid" "The Sun" "made it funny with" "Dad Bod". ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no part."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to play alone in a run over 100 metres of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">"frenetic, Moussambani was fired back then."</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic meter of sewage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Weldingahl 3.44 instead of until now 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.8 euro (up to now 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to now 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the sewage charges will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after an excessive calculation, the waste-water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the Kulmbach Landratsamt, Kulmbach was established that undercover these wastewater facilities."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants on a cost-top basis."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises of Weldingahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Head of Management Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calendar period may be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt thus founded the engraving of all three sewage plants with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, wastewater volumes are slightly declining in all three plants."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the recumbent calculation period of all three systems, not least due to their age renovation and repair expenditures were incurred in a considerable extent."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Weldingahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf wastewater plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the pumping station Weldingahl, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after almost 20 years operation the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed and an additional ventilation capability will be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "to these extraordinary expenses came the continual assistance and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low wastewater treatment the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully integrated in the three systems.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the process, Schmidt continued to have spared the market community of great entertainment costs for wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned systems will remain precarious in the long run, especially since one cannot expand the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sanitary ware association in order to not be able to expand these facilities because these facilities are sanitary facilities."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat tells that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unclear, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million selfies selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have criticized their accusation that the app Blackface would promote or promote white skin as beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slots, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow vision. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity of diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the messages and the indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat, that it would have deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurting clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet on the photos became widely used that the filter was" hurtful "and the least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not safe, but that the yellow face was pulled into the abused extremity."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural drift.</seg>

<seg id="19">And snapchats great audience of young people - who are diversed in terms of race as their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said, she believes that racist controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the control practices at Snapchat."</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership fraudulent ISIS intelligence services, establishes Congressional Committee"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in order to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a committee of inquiry held in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Armed Forces, Intelligence Committees and the Defence Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically sent from top-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "introduced Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government officials under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, republican representative of Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they had been admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom Reports are underway by the Secretary of Defense of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">The Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively constrained process for the creation of intelligence reports on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," said the highest-ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff, delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "gave overly little room for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported on the Pentagon's Chief Inspector who were surveyed by Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while investigations of the General Inspector are still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the Secret Societies on the Islamic State reminds of disagreements of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, saw only a small occupation forces in Iraq and little time on it to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms's dam, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature owing to his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="10">"whatever the game on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time with three years playing a hockey racket (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the National Player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to turn things for better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workstation in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatched the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the goings in the first half of the game with a flashback from the closeup.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was in the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team showed a surprisingly tough time and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball above the left flank, then moved into the middle and plouted the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2-0 leadership."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Rio de Janeiro's events feel durable and inevitable, a rapid relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed down from the wristband to the swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting queue in the coffeeshop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's warm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that were sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well-being TV commercials when he would be a swimmers, turner, or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade there are the sports that are not universally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many that I had questioned were not aware that there was at all an Olympic site."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and had had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on a trampoline has some outsiders, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending collision - but also the Grazie of gymnastic and diving, the two sports that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means a springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising conquerors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, real and saltos) before landing on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"you will be judged according to the official Olympic program after execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest to go gold further, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes round and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"it not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transmission also another height goal: that of the world or the Olympia bay."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attacker and the objective rating of male athletes - as the male US turner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Dooley expects his air rinting, new fans."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that sixty protestors were killed during collisions with police in gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and widened into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was unrelentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were shot and killed on zig unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security men hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN authority on human rights now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, with dissidents being effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed, or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after an extensive criticism of last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea are increasing; a struggle for this zacky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts argue that separatists such as the Oromo-liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can use turmoil and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness tend to explode after years of hypocrisy under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does not lock access to Facebook and Twitter what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate about Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians thanked that they were so much protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas prospered predominantly Christian high-nationals from Ethiopia, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well-versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region North of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an upheaval in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, according to analysts apparently pledged by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of disturbances went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal confusion of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"protesters in Gondar, an ampersist city, run by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray become more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dronenic flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to clearly support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his statement Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump attempted to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades, who endeavour to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, to explain statements which he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew in reference to the assertion on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism rushed down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but he later explained" "Of course I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "according to what the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed a more pronounced tone, because his demand values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent representatives, gave great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it butler, completely false, and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread it by subjecting the situation in the Middle East aggressively."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going round on each of his words and to be taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he scorned the" poor, miserable "television experts trying to understand him and said," You can't! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps excuse as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at Oval Office."</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs latest book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, medium-sized snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock crash 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Bowman, 54, ordered a fresh bowl with olive trees, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable blend."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as the reporter ordered minced meat, this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "Ziegelman said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut-bread, Leberkäse and Bohnenbrot."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper, which stretches the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served fresh baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "sets out the ways in which the country was moving to no longer be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe sled why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgetary was just as tense: mysterious food such as loaves and saucers became staple foods that could rewind casserolle as a" wonderful species, eating leftovers "because cooks could hide unappetiable ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar mixtures were tested, as a calorie-rich and nourishing gratification had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen-sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes prescriptions, Brickman prepared a dish from that period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the house business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before, or ever since, drive budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by announcing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" housekeeping women "and to meet the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "a Square Meal" "is a feast of historic treat."</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, like president Herbert Hoover's ass-me-cake-meal-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly lauded the simple Iowa peasant-house kitchen of his kitchen, he appealed as the millionous man of the world to whom he had become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cooking like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and held a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was terrific to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statuate with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, a housekeeper had no interest in flavors due to Mrs. Roosevelt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-hai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the ship ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland is only 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland-shark is floored at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches just 1.220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, however, seems to be a foolishness for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science in any case from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist thought for a long time that Greenland will become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-harks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow-motion-pentagons, when they carried out six animals with a transmitter in front of the Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this shark nonetheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for carcasses that tortoise from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandsharks looking for fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest Hai was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest cm cm measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins in it are later no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were notably carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, after the early 1960s, her birth was supposed to be as an atomic weapon for large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal in the length of 220 centimeters, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens-core, that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed a 493-centimeter long Greenland-shark an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could associate an old age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the current record holder, an 211 year old Greenland vale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was caught, was captured in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they attack later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministries of the minister-care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were overcome."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time to the next Romantic journey of all ministries in two years, the round of ministerial round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one decided finally for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim destination was offered during the Holy Year of Mercy."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern, were on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before the pastor, Priost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and distributed the Pilgrim Cross."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb it was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster young lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis on fieldcruises, chapels or churches repeatedly made a song to sing together a song from a specially arranged pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights there were parish halls of the local parishes available.</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went through Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"after that, one stepped on the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but at the same time, they had to get off at about 500 metres in high heat and then again be heard again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a shared barbecue on the beach in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulses on the fourth pilgrim day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Schotte Callum Skinner stormed at home, as Brite Gold scored for cycling"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Scotland's call for Skinner raves last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy himself."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy got the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they held in March at the World Championships in London in spite of the back Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the gravel that has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner scored a Olympic ord in the qualification laps, but the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, with the passing in a higher gear, in order to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the 2012 triumph at the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes stated that after a weak start he intentionally dropped onto the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team during the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for the British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the case of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I only enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in four-four kilometers."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"world Record, which won Gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he fought with representatives before the qualification, calling him officials to measure his body size."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's contest, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team relies on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a string of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton played in the middle of sex and moped allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the abolition of the energy demand</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - stand at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply contracts, such as delivering energy companies."</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year to grant no further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is running in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting rate consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Melting, which resulted in a closing of the Anglesea Power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting shop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through melting", "the Company informed."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so called" "hedging transactions", "which would have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12-month cancellation period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the current supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL receipts from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it has already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in" "expectation of cancellation". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" ability Alcoas... to operate the melt, or to ensure power to melt "does not interfere."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland had some 600 megawatts and a total of around 900 MW of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both plants disappear from the market this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator it would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and went to fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this verse brought me to cry," "Kendall wrote."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or just keeping up with the Kardashians), which shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest."</seg>
<seg id="6">"that represents the clichy offense almost every birthday present of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought you had forgotten?" "with honesty of a cartoon on a Senate at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to participate in this publicity somehow."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians started."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that is rather similar to a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue pulls a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista of the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover-star is expected to be so long-awaited that in the last two years the magazine will still seep ahead of the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years more "celebrities that model" as "models that are celebrities" are on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner is described as the" "Durchbruchid" "of her generation - under the former category, it is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything is based on common denominator).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jennett's success does not like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenners was always excited about the world of fashion."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the mists of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">"these feelings boil up again, when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover."</seg>
<seg id="23">But to move around on the mism seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successor still dominates the world - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good at hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite clunky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which today would suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>

<seg id="9">"the" "Nokia 9000 communicator" "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros enthusiasts can buy devices still on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months ago at the Cebit in Hannover as an "office in the western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator could be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, though very slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mobile branch of Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and wound to Microsoft."</seg>

<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just like in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of extension Heathrows is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we'll be blaming at the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two flyers had wronged in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome but Heathrow answers every question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and in the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented runways of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games in 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as to secure our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have recorded similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and yet it slowly turned further."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic versatility to host lives and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed for almost two months," explained GISS Scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rain umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected of planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions years --was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogene, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide escapes with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently targeted businesses - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware Defense Specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at ransomware extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in corporate networks according to the observations of Malwareytes."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to invent ransom is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently observe a terrifying rapid evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered the blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred rapidly in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as to archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and clears the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptoid Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had even had to interrupt business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute acute by the loss of accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: pay not, you only fund the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the blackouts and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to make more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, establish freely accessible support websites, or decrypt example files for nothing."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partially negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from Ransomware extortion, hackers become more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackboards.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the so-called malware-kits have been created by the malware, providing advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackboards then look for more hackers in order to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"thus, one logically logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set from a criminal and mandates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals will commission the spammer with the spread," Wisniewski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50% of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful assessment, the perpetrators are threatening instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chef Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"this means that damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds rather overloaded, but the HR V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the HR-V is only a small size of 1.60 metres, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work tight at any point."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant, only the cockpit top falls out there."</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a boot of 453 l available for uploading and 1026 l with upswing backrests, but there are the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin-chairs and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m from the floor to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, his work should be somewhat quieter."</seg>
<seg id="13">The average daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the tested top variant, the equipment leaves nothing to be desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the security systems belong to the City emergency braking system (operates at speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane assistance assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warner sometimes irritates, because when shunting, he evaluates many obstacles as" "approaching objects." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temporegler responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttle if necessary the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI female are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top-diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest as much will receive the petrol from 20,000 euros, diesel from 23,000 Euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you can walk around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the mornings there is no more to think of sleep in the morning before the wake of the alarm bells."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes can be attributed to them," says Hans-Günter Weeping, member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Schlaeforem and Sleep Medicine. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a one in and through-sleep disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just the sleeping sense many people perceive as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagner-necht, member of the German HomeMedical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs can be put into place."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often frequent in depression," "says Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a hernia case, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances go to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, should go to the doctor, advises weaken."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look very different: one is tired, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there are hardly any sleep medical practitioners in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary bed-care centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of insomnia, one should first turn to the family doctor, advises wether."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"in case of snoring with respiratory droplers, in case of illness or if you do not find the cause of insomnia, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a midday sleep," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After capping you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal mask, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera draws the sleeping place on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">"there are quite a lot of screws, where you can sleep for better sleep."</seg>
<seg id="35">"weeping is counting on: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol avoid and at night don't look at the watch - then you start to reckon instantly, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still a rest of the cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like that, but the police is one of the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>

<seg id="4">"in front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the article about this" "trendy district", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, is, however, preferred by burning cars in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the inhabitants have tenants, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel has spoken several times for a harsh police action against the project, the area called" No-Go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadmiths, had been swept away with 300 police officers, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wagons on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown landowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later police and builders rejected the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of houses in the sun, others talk about Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children, are especially generalised by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the building projects, they share the concerns about rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wanted several local police protection against the vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house owners and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which also has a low average income and a high poverty rate in comparison to the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer Strasse close to the Rīga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was placed under large police charge in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and ballads from all over the world over the past few years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on cast windows or newly painted facades that were dug with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offences render defects, which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of insecurity."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is crucial: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been this."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will no longer give it to the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remains.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important for her to get back the street: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by unsighted new buildings in former construction gaps, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well drunk", "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone does not listen to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration in all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for breeders who are fond of color bombs: the building project and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in fact, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work so far as you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments need to be recovered, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internship placements, apprenticeships, training places, one-euro jobs and backup job for refugees and migrants that need to be rounded or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Kunde. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a firm structure, say Deuschle and the customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so we need special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, administration and volunteers are also jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central, that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever would eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, may not be able to work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problem cases, too, says the customer," people with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do they have fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what a certain naïve name may call." a residual risk cannot and would not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These occurrences are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins brought them up completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the local and local volunteers need to look out for activities in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new shot of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics disguises itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it's unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Client also makes clear that the Urbacher has already been busy to integrate the previous people into a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
