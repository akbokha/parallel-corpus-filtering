Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing policies in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlement construction and repro@@ aches Net@@ any@@ ahu lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal promoted by Obama for Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this at the time im@@ min@@ ent election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , professor is entitled to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cut on a white block : &quot; I am sorry , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Political Bureau Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the firing at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police had tied him .
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said that he did not have a history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; lamb himself had mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had asked the Delta State University for a complaint for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he conducted only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found lam@@ bs , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ ics . &quot;
he did a doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy , who tried several years to teach her the guitar . &quot;
at that time he was the women &apos;s s@@ warm .
&quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ sh when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together with one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5th , after that Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clean @-@ up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony . &quot;
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot dead , and that lamb testi@@ fied in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season
&quot; Toys R Us says there will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in 2014 , 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , Christmas is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox shines on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater wait for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated drawing and a length of arm from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ str@@ ing@@ ently the biggest time @-@ trip movie ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN CEO once again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and facilitate inclusive negotiation to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - at the si@@ delines of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly , to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks , it has ( yet ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which only gained a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey results suggest@@ ing that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of repub@@ lican voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of Irish voters think that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not go to the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they raise their mit@@ es , Repub@@ lican voters are tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
this is a change since the time four of ten ended their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; however , a large number of GO@@ P voters watch Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign to be plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump almost hits everybody . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most of the other repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump sums up the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have firmly assigned their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind . &quot;
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they match with tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago , called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; immig@@ rated to Mexico , was the immigration hub and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the 2016 public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump critical Hez@@ bollah @-@ Americans will be kept away from the Repub@@ lican Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they match with tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration threat@@ ens in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it seems to do Donald Tr@@ ump as well . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accoun@@ ted for about half the support of repub@@ lican voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany &quot;
here in Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street a square meter of a roof@@ ed house will cost 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt , the range of objects is limited by nature , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a Studenten@@ werk in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Real Estate Service Provider Engel &amp; V@@ √∂lk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ ering prizes in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , noticed . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich is not at the top here , as an exception . &quot;
champ@@ ions League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
double Tor@@ sch√ºt@@ ze in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller simply has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller gave the way to FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it went .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol @-@ hits ( 89@@ . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth victory in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th match in the Champions League , M√ºller received ben@@ evol@@ ent assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who made a f@@ lange of the world champion &apos;s mind . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich were talking . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shine .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the King &apos;s class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; however , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , the Bav@@ arians did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dly , but often too resour@@ c@@ eful in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by bac@@ kl@@ ash on le@@ ft@@ land Douglas Costa , which was rarely penet@@ rated against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; M√ºller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the upper right of the tor@@ so . &quot;
&quot; in the six@@ teenth minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St√ºr@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown suggested the pol@@ ish@@ ball of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians raised their usual domin@@ ating game , Pir@@ √§us was able to put con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye about the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ad @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the fa@@ der , sat outside at first . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Her@@ o first gave the green light after the final training , said sport director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; during the first move , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter M√ºller added one more . &quot;
in front of the game there had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly mixed Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ block obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts pir@@ ates with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with sticks against Munich &apos;s supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam . &quot;
good news : the risk of aband@@ on@@ ment sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers were the risk of pre@@ matur@@ ely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes for tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is thus attribut@@ able to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ val infections in smo@@ kers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers sin@@ ke , explained Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the British University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one has to persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing of the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and also leads to good dental health until old age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arche@@ ologists encounter rem@@ n@@ ants from the ancient town of Rhein@@ u@@ fer on the remains of the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , &quot; &quot; said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum will always be added as an expert for archae@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves has also been discovered which belonged to the church . &quot;

&quot; to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function is clearly more traditional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; explained the EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m with the idea . &quot;
the Swe@@ de has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration practice suggest that the EU states and the US are jointly choosing independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is scheduled for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the proced@@ ural parties agreed to each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussions over the past few months , it became clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , comm@@ enting Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment decision according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; for example , there could be dispute between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the Investor @-@ Sta@@ ats Ar@@ bit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) tri@@ bun@@ als ( IS@@ DS ) above all are considered to be one of the main reasons for the big opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of ri@@ pen@@ ess vis @-@ √† @-@ vis the companies to en@@ force claims against tax@@ pay@@ ers to en@@ force national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act mentioned the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it was critici@@ zed above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; however , the German economic state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission considers important points in the reform , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel elabor@@ ated in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restri@@ c@@ ting the charges of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) negotiations can be concluded , it continued un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; so far , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is nearly touched by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of different places , which he repeatedly shows on the map , about his meticul@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were created , and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; with the release of the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever composed songs , which harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , can always be great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a disc@@ ar@@ ded series : each of the 50 states should be followed in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
&quot; one year later , the musician comes back to the series in New York . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Van@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a nationwide celebrated masterpiece . &quot;
over@@ flowing with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic pieces of reference .
&quot; this sixth neat studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long ago the smaller clubs have gone up , the stage shows are here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the glo@@ omy Hamburg mehr !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
&quot; although there are nearly 2000 guests sitting in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one can hear from the audience : the lecture was &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one could therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; record in essence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens only thank@@ ed herself for an enc@@ ore , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s frei@@ ghts
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns made his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire with sus@@ pen@@ se
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frei@@ ghts and set himself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will stand up to take the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch where his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision , on Tuesday during a commemor@@ ative ceremony celebrating the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several cover page stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect of silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; &quot; independent &quot; &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen NGOs have refused to serve as leaders in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference urged Labour to make changes in order to remove all the idea of a constra@@ int altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions ministers , said that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; is that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been the T@@ ory leader in the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader who has promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo must be con@@ front@@ ational and that he will be subjected to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle the shadow of economic ministers will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road .
&quot; he has also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally grasp the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the House and its position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed extensive reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; the Po@@ und went jumping like data , indicating an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without any bonuses in the UK rose by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the quick@@ est and profitable rate of interest at the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a leap of 20 % after the acquisition offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were below encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - report back growth again .
&quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction . &quot;
&quot; the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had &quot; &quot; sold &quot; &quot; his estimate for the company rating . &quot;
JD activity rose by 3.1 % after the company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages risk expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labor cost of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA Poster brings Lebanese to Pot@@ ato @-@ Twe@@ ed @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂ner ?
&quot; both - and in the Pot@@ ato d@@ √∂ner , which the Oldenburg I@@ mb@@ ahn owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida rally , with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; which he had seen on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer sp@@ ends in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile banned the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ h@@ ay will therefore not reveal . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with his customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Ground Clear@@ ance Campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ ci@@ dent
met@@ a tries to protect IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash launched a ground@@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples distributed in IG@@ A stores and shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes further details of his defence strategy on September 29th , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual Investor @-@ Strateg@@ i@@ et@@ ag . &quot;
it is much at stake since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in quantities on a high fixed cost base , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ before interest and taxes , &quot; said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2015 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; the i@@ gas market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on revenues and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler dev@@ ours and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to compens@@ ate retail prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to supply IG@@ A retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs will be set on ver@@ ve , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as criticism of his own behaviour according to the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the not@@ orious discussion of Kyr@@ gy@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison had called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a fight for a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; a thing about which I am rather br@@ anded , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little in the argument , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost the U.S. Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the locker room , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ os in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around the world &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate themselves in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation . &quot;
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip at the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian pro@@ vision@@ ing police . &quot;
some exp@@ elled from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc could not agree on a joint immigration policy in a controversial meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hopes that the EU states would receive more than 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action by Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were used in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Ne@@ ar East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees who are looking for a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency state , &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deep into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire in order to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos converted the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push for a crowd . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; vice @-@ president , Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is the candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some winn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; your support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders just returned with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the di@@ ci@@ bility are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the pres@@ election , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ tons followers say more than half , that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far before S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead will increase from S@@ anders , 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race against 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure decreased by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; chosen &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters will ask questions about elec@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the past month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the election of the pres@@ election is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics among voters of the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den regard maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den effectively cuts the three candidates with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters don &apos;t think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and server are still being asked as an external minister during office term , most of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general views , though 36 percent said that their opinion was still deterior@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trusted by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights also regard Tr@@ ump as non @-@ honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good scores at the lead . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush go best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest news from C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters support in the new survey , and others lose a dramatic stop . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters continue supporting tr@@ ump in large numbers across the country . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son decreased from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican constitu@@ ents with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ uns , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell on the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support in the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ eves for former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps belief . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; bathroom temperatures , on the other hand , continues to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even rises to up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch college no@@ vice
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ apped ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of New York Bar@@ uch , College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supposedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ sil began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle above the &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g &quot; , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , den@@ g was added repeatedly with d@@ ull force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the chic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of suspic@@ ious attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - official or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold these to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch &apos;s College has banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a stake in interest is coming , and the hou@@ set@@ ter will fall , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ veness in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have emphasized so sharply that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather over the period needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here &apos;s a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be discounted from 12 to 24 months after the first raise , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has been in the last 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average yield in the past six last cycles of asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return starts to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and could accelerate the recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 were only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 per cent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky , and raise the question of &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all In@@ cre@@ ase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing soon after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in stocks when they change their strategic course .
bonds appear to change direction as soon as the first raise / lowering in the cycle takes place .
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ists believe that the increase in interest rates will result in advancing relationships between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a curve of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , a fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; large and whole companies will benefit from the greater part of their business operations in the US , where interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational corporations with high debt are getting worse as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; qualit@@ y- &quot; shares tend to react very positively to three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings can see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critici@@ zed the channel for his &quot; &quot; di@@ mm@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she just im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ itters do not . &quot;
&quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontan@@ eously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC CEO dism@@ issed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 would fly far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public@@ ity .
&quot; what I learn about Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on behalf , I really consider important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controll@@ ed Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was set under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not very distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in special BBC mode .
&quot; he added that he wanted the company &quot; &quot; to hit a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; &quot; when the next time it was a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from fee counter@@ s for other entertainment formats . &quot;
&quot; in August , Internet sales were slow@@ ing down and Black Friday could be responsible for this . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down expenses
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into spirit cities . &quot;
experts say there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; when you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as purch@@ as@@ ers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as home on the sofa .
&quot; but now this happens , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for decreasing revenue . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites threw away . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that ¬£ 5 spending was issued a little more than ¬£ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims at the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia is putting down the collapse in part of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane fell
hundreds of Muslims were gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead that were killed when a crane fell to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandmother .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to declare their respect when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before had a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the ends . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed over the construction company of Bin Laden thanks to the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beg@@ gar@@ s killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Park Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the yearly H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sh will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to go to the city .
&quot; king Sal@@ man said today , the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane than he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane into a courtyard of the great mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment . &quot;
the Royal decree also t@@ opped the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mek@@ ka &apos;s grandmother as part of the massive building project led by the bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the dead leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the overthrow of the crane was in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of each healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; government representatives ruled that 1 million ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded . &quot;
other injured receive half of this amount .

&quot; V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the tree nursery chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is meanwhile over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women . &quot;
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends , which have more female single households having more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this stronger to a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has owned 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a drop in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group failed to pay the costs for closing the shops .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , the Kl@@ agen@@ furt District Court announced two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ bug@@ ging . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been acqu@@ itted legally in May . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary study cryst@@ alli@@ zed out that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were mon@@ ies of associations which they were allowed to use in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; in order to ev@@ ade the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence claimed that at no time an asset was created at any time . &quot;
&quot; the sport function@@ aries were only compens@@ ated for expenses and the sport club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the passi@@ v@@ ants entered in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were confronted with the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the Bread B@@ alls Conf@@ essor of the Finance Ministry . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have put money to lay down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said in the collection . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it can only be done without debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of financial success , compensation of expenses compens@@ ated retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 was decided . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expense damage was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump sum and no details of detail appeared , the former chairman explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and parag@@ rap@@ hs shared the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the Club was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association didn &apos;t care about financial support in detail , but it was important to pay the debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , contrary to the one function@@ ary investigations on account of abuse , an amount of 120,000 Euro was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that were appropri@@ ations , declared the defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant , and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; after all , he said he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the defend@@ ant was informed , justi@@ fi@@ ably the function@@ ary . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , we wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding because the association was never damaged .
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned with o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he took charge of ‚Ç¨ 1,000 a month for di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were unable to show exact documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept in store after a test in which everything was judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter was also referred to as the second employee .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings can be made in cash , in order to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard opens another 30.000 Jobs
&quot; in addition to personnel mining , which has been running for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;

&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 @-@ 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) are to be saved on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;

R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : breakdown of violence against Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke tear@@ gas and floo@@ d@@ light against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police line there was a police line and behind the police there was a water@@ shed .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially put an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
many tear@@ gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn something back .
a pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether interest rates are raised for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist , and the interest rates will last at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest dropped to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Senior Fel@@ low at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude view of global proportions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death Sp@@ ins at the Delta State University released ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , He killed someone and killed one . &quot;
&quot; lamb told the staff of the emergency call center , that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted it , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb ran for 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een who said that she was married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ sh would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he will not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ emen depos@@ ited it on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his CV on the University &apos;s website .

all this certainly challenges his toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group by
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 with around 1,000 executives all around the world will cost the company &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; however , with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and enhances the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the objective of re@@ orientation is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings cheap airline should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ aud will be responsible for Euro@@ wings as CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s Passage , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the case of collective bar@@ gaining with the cock@@ pit ( VC ) pilot agreement , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the first strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record result , cock@@ pit wants to come as quickly as possible to viable results . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competi@@ tor circuits , Lufthansa moved to the company &apos;s own bil@@ let line Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of dou@@ bling frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double fac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside def@@ ender to crying and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not expect Sha@@ w to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H√©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double penetration and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the hanging of a mil@@ limeter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ m and a red card are due .
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
from this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V defeat
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico playing against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost entirely . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the eco @-@ label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , where Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead adding a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ un @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , reading her wish to see a real tree , &quot; &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be enough : the text presented by Cameron is part of the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ un @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , falls due to the c@@ ash@@ y , trees that fall in the name of the trees , &quot; &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 consecutive years in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably coming from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s election circle office .
&quot; Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there were no immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; this news @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ res , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer are geared to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this to players - players are their best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully strikes more purchases on Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his stance , even if he did not get such good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son , before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first sat down in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer I value highly . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and receive four ticks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred battles right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of back@@ ups that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the aforementioned . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the one @-@ day &apos;s , R@@ oot got a similar rest against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not specify the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in the heart .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ educated ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it &quot; Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was fierce because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always of its own debt , Britain &apos;s self created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of finance climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to look outside the UK outside the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we are staying or going . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has done with the exagger@@ ated long @-@ handed people like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French Fran√ßois Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a fl@@ ashing force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Britain , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won no value from ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they may remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who took a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all his mad@@ ness , Ed knew Mili@@ band who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ prin@@ c@@ esses , telephone @-@ burning aliens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are more ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band had more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then dism@@ issed by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press never passed him away .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to waste time for me - seems to be at risk , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80@@ ies , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ den@@ cy and the wild followers of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can say Yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs had fought in it , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ S &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their party on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the ag@@ ony bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the vort@@ ex of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins probably thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a key principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is deeply convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin turn away political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et concluded by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Law Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a Model for Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine content products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Instrument ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include an industry finance in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line was attended by p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group is &quot; &quot; reve@@ al@@ ingly &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are far less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to this , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year with regard to smoking , and smoking will cost the national health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by the clear pre@@ disposition of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should quit the East@@ enders , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used only to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for placing publicly legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of transm@@ itters like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , which I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , one should at least make its production on programs that others do not do or put into commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as wide support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs that could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
&quot; I would like to see myself , how this should be public @-@ legal television . &quot;
I don &apos;t think it would decrease the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of the people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart &apos;s lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggest@@ ing that the BBC shows like East@@ enders would sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they are fulfilling their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion ¬£ broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course you think everybody thinks that you get a great value for 150 ¬£ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 ¬£ , I wonder if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain this in public @-@ law channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television is shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically altered nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they reson@@ ate with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which releases electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread@@ worms do not normally react to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did so when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms . &quot;
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P 4 ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when it applies ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ sc@@ apes and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stations and subway trains and require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : drive from September 15th to 18th with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads the signature of the London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into a tank &apos;s image . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising campaign for the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ ous company advertisement , but &quot; by the blo@@ om with bright colors and animation it remains strong . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally at our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , I was a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those who I anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most I &apos;ve learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ous to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to wat@@ ered : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , if and where you have taken sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like , unlike those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks @-@ recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and put their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receives a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ asting culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ ability - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking on .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
&quot; as you begin the Uni at the climax of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , is less wei@@ rd than the greeting of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty treats is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to sleeping when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the claw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my ro@@ ommate , adding a washing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just a matter of being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , if it makes them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she let her neighbours sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too deep embarrass@@ ing when you keep a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse , move to them and see them again each day , and perhaps to experience how they move all common friends to themselves ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak a little reason to your abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his key in his not locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good starting point is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place through plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never ch@@ ew somebody &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your poss@@ essions on the blanket no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , One @-@ to @-@ One , Ger@@ ing@@ deser@@ ved &quot;
real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds on the Francon@@ ian Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need home @-@ room , but also the mother and the gro@@ oved . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and build good things today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flood of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ d : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when you teach people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs . &quot;
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ de@@ ux : &quot; &quot; construc@@ tively I have gone through my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated it is always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking space ordin@@ ance .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still accommod@@ ated , who creates three flats in a terrac@@ ed house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is no place for that .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
Gil@@ lian : there were those who accused me of creating lux@@ uries for asylum seek@@ ers .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , tap &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software update . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by installing the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is finished . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch on half @-@ way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; in the fight for the championship title in Formula One against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup kick@@ ed off into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I had nothing left to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in front of the second race in Singapore on this Sunday of defending champion and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .

&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old British was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still un@@ clear .

bad Kis@@ singer chess club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , so the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross Cross 1st Class and Hon@@ orary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann helped the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which Chairman Alfred Klein met .
&quot; thus it is possible to record chess players , who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth Work and Talent Search should also be promoted .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; red @-@ white &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ b√ºro searches for direct contact
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; have joined the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation puts it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have established with our out@@ patient nursing service that often caring relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; not rarely many services of the insur@@ ers are not claimed because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ovi@@ ch and the B√ºrger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as storm prevention , reminder , or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , CEO of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future imperative .
&quot; in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) subordin@@ ate to the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the neighbourhood office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ alising supplement . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution that senior citizens can live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at about 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ ane , followed the police with their two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men was crying out to the young people and hit the face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al leg and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ et , he left his victim at first . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to the apartment and demonstr@@ atively passed over there .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any longer , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and the upper th@@ ig@@ h of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
template Object could not be unser@@ i@@ alized successfully .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second r@@ ack@@ et should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank M√ºller to acquire Fel@@ steh@@ aus practice and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen .
&quot; on top of this , also the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ f√∂rder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank M√ºller will take over the practice of Fel@@ gen@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , M√ºller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 Euro in the rooms at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the fel@@ lows met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who are currently completing their specialist training at the Golden Hospital and will also join the practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply ph@@ oned her . &quot;
the Mu@@ eller M√ºller liked the idea to pursue its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Mu@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know the families over the years , and accompany them . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so one agreed , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice . &quot;
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there the two @-@ time father Frank M√ºller grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and involved voluntarily in the DRC @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ aus lives as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a house@@ keeper . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ modeling , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ bearing EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros will receive the garbage collection from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ Gemein@@ hardt Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2,000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ gen@@ ausen every quarter , in the North German average practice , it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor would have found , it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , anyone who visits M√ºll@@ ers &apos;s consultations will continue to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus gle@@ efully . &quot;
a bit of melanch@@ oly they already feel after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
your husband complet@@ es : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request , can do so &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; however , it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled as an outside border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister pointed out , the Slov@@ ene wants to cut its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government agreed , the first refugees had already attempted in the night hours on Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has since been meeting police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4000 refugees , said Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had led migrants to the Hungarian border , would be diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to suggest the people to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been around the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia all night long .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the Balkans @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary has already predicted the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkans @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , stressed earlier that his country has prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot;
&quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic immediately tried to paci@@ fy a local apparently in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
&quot; it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
workers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared mines 20 years after the end of the Croatian border . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges / h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime , which is accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der @-@ shops should have been made in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators have projected a total of more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C release . &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case lasted .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their worries , partly quick steps , partly comfortably stroll . &quot;
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
city rail@@ ways keep .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life with wonderful autumn sun and in the middle of it four large panels each with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice help drew attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zeit is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions as the volunteers .
&quot; while some people spontan@@ eously grab@@ s the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; read my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , there are little discussion about the action itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I make it clear that eventually the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian plant Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bear@@ er of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , it is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has helped many people open up . &quot;
an estim@@ ation that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and death attend@@ ant is one of the hon@@ orary staff of the first hour .
&quot; confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zeit by Appe@@ al sought , she immediately reported and was present in the year 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job well with her experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another warning , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as further training and supervision of the ster@@ ling and mour@@ ning attend@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
&quot; the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , other personal wishes can be noted on post@@ cards . &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier gig@@ ant lowered his earnings outlook for a year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes prior to the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10@@ ,90 in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tions . &quot;
analysts expected a fac@@ t@@ Set to be $ 10.@@ 84 .
&quot; despite the price increases , the lower view will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for body@@ building transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November onwards . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; provides solid earnings if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , who plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share came to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to ‚Ç¨ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts up@@ asked $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a drop in international pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation , which posted sales in its unit express delivery . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results from Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex stocks declined by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; on its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed se@@ eding hall is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress to keep US employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the un@@ parall@@ eled incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company , Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led by itself to the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of raising . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow as they promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average was 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that she would not panic . &quot;
other experts argue that a interest rate would calm financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence will be expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed regards as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the month after China exploited its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US bank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed &apos;s International Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere indication of the leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , dissolved del@@ usions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global Strategy for Net As@@ sets Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; h@@ acker , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia promp@@ ted the F@@ ed to lower their loans by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited evident impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives removed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ences do not come near this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains double mand@@ ates and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should take the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; Chin@@ at@@ own , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / bearing was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often called Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / storage is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life assistance for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; even with her 74 conferences , she still loves to teach . &quot;
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at the Dill@@ inger Stra√üe .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan , learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who are painted on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should take . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new member of the Sport Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ table construction at the Bern@@ ese sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the Panel had , among other things , decided to apply a constitutional &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; the permission was given for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof over@@ hangs &quot; should be established . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; liberation &quot; in turn , on the other hand , was about the ascent , which for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan stipul@@ ated - should lie under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan for the slope no &quot; exceptions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the same time , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and wide sport promotion .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the council office for inspection . &quot;
Klinik Pei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees run from Pei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on it will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ √üen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further internal station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; entered the game , who agreed to take over the lead on October 1 and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and an extension of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer will work with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in Pei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the District has planned this in 2018 if the current renovation of the hospital at Wei@@ l@@ heim is completed . &quot;
&quot; Mr J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also the chair@@ person of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ ed rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a conference psychiat@@ rist .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the Pei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar L√∂wen are called tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but nobody exists . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener ob@@ tains a painful defeat in the B@@ HC and have something to protect there . &quot;
Jag@@ dun@@ estation with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police shared . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were placed in hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could happen to the accident was un@@ clear at first .
the ci@@ d police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ ses of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was forced to kill the young people and cast their dead into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , is also deemed to indicate the statement and lead investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday mor@@ nings , after having come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in the search for the young woman , investig@@ ators first found personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing persons , a crime was made against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator brought the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities admitted that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the dead were put into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him a total load . &quot;
the further investigation should bring about the near@@ er conditions of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long begun .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Federal Bureau of Social Housing .
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ time accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not limited to rising refugee figures . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in Germany , a housing deficit is emerging , which is increasing from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , some 77@@ 0,000 residential units were already missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , compl@@ aining Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study . &quot;
many working people therefore stayed in large cities necessary in WG rooms .
young adults happily stayed no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the low @-@ rise in the housing market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the foundations for subsidi@@ zed dwell@@ ings will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are required according to the Alliance . &quot;
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W government is already proceeding well in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the launch , 184 million euros has already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with more than half of the available around 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia follow the corridor
&quot; according to Hungary , practically no more passage is possible , as more and more refugees choose the way about Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing its transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
&quot; on the day before , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees . &quot;
&quot; new laws , which came into effect on the same day , also make an almost superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedure in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees go .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
&quot; most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived by bus as well as taxis in the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to reach the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter a fence . &quot;
this poses other dangers to the crossing : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; in Hungary , however , hardly any more refugees arrive after the closure of the border . &quot;
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 people attacked .
&quot; shortly before closure on Monday , it had been 93@@ 80 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws determine the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
&quot; in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
sentenced pen@@ alties for up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , there were 94 asylum applications in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe country country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deport@@ ed there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the tr@@ ash that tens of thousands of people left the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier gates have been disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border town has been reconstructed .
nobody wanted to express itself to the objective of this reconstruction .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants , however , still remained in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train service from there to Germany was stopped by instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing we regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprised the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the flood of refugees , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ ri@@ pped the fr@@ inge together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Middle @-@ Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we have only once cooked the un@@ hoped @-@ for guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers switched from an ICE into a regional train in direction Pass@@ au to try it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try beyond the border . &quot;
the regional train was stopped at the Inn in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ party association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ bridge race spor@@ tively - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n is now sending further Z@@ ig@@ gens to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in building structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and openly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ oultry will also need to find out that the &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to produce decent conditions for people seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters &quot;
&quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has to deal with all his hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no more hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; he told of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , which came to Austria on Monday , was carried out without great vor@@ tices , said Conrad and praised the organisational &quot; Meister@@ leistung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; altogether , Konrad is expecting a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quartz animals in the year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 properties must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will provide the federal states , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , to be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator also supports great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; moreover , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of need , it cannot be that district enco@@ ders have to hold a certain height of the towel rail or size of the head@@ light . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he was more successful with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cost the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
&quot; until now , its own accommodation search has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz is calling for a better distribution
&quot; first , there is no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can &apos;t accommodate those concerned at the moment without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
other areas also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday cor@@ ded the further action in the issue of refugees . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot;
there will be no longer any special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , those seeking asylum seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot;
the fact that Austria now also carries out controls on its borders is for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; New Adver@@ ts &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies of the new ship@@ yard , and later also to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er expects a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; at 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria and the Federal Association ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ter opened secondary business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; actually , Jutta has wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : after all , she now got an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before , several weeks have been changed . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has placed Br@@ eit von her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
why so some woman wearing a nice hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can &apos;t answer the expert with the last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is enhanced every outfit .
the P@@ jes@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
&quot; this feature , together with the billi@@ on@@ aire , wants to become US President . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for up@@ sets .
&quot; whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalist or lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair @-@ hair @-@ hair@@ style is a term many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign . &quot;
the all@@ city of Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native k@@ all@@ city has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous young@@ sters , to which , apart from Tr@@ ump , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nickname that K@@ all@@ stadt had in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ etter &quot; &quot; - too high German : the enco@@ der , says it . &quot;
hence Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a loc@@ ale for gold tom@@ bs in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their wish to return to their homeland in the long run , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once divor@@ ced without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the film release . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and required the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the polar , it is not so lik@@ eable , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative trace ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement is rather dist@@ ancing the American , &quot; he is always so brow@@ ning . &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the landlord Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , like many k@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which generally arrived well . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t want the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those , who had been in the USA at the time of his grandfather , would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ land@@ lady Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for whom Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ at@@ chers , also in the USA the interest is w@@ aking up . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavaria community Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a reserve .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership during the Today Show
&quot; Charles Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son are rus@@ hing to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 viewers at the five main cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
&quot; in August Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 was compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September , sunrise has an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these dawn more than parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the ex @-@ series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and lightly beat The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e revealed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before coming out of three two , you might acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips to the final on Thursday sealed
&quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and , in doing so , called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last Rose ? , &quot; could be their answers to the game spoil who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and realised ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth at both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; the One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ conditional on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30@@ h . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank , as he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League Conver@@ ti@@ t at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also reinforced Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL Debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his origin debut in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

free voters demand the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ Autumn Bla@@ de in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters ad@@ jour@@ ns until Friday in the Lower Francon@@ ian Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite other main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum is going to over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as did during the ninet@@ een se@@ ven@@ ties during the Yugoslavia . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we have to address the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; for that reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also requested more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum proceedings : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised the fact that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more action @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s politics should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing continuous burner remains on the order of the day : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , the Minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; at 47 schools in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um middle class will be tested for three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the theme G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the FW @-@ chief . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after demonstrating rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have deployed tear@@ gas and then fired into the air before returning to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , which are known to kill , but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ ja@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent con@@ front@@ ations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re@@ buil@@ ted .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square metres area .
&quot; a mix of trade , trade and living is planned - but there are still no concrete offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 m ¬≤ plot in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , trade and housing . &quot;
&quot; if you wait for corresponding offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the land , which is located on the Ring@@ stra√üe ( corner of the Gro√üe Stra√üe ) , bought already a few months ago and the building had to be torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
planning for the holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many tra@@ ilers are further troubled - they fear the exp@@ elling of their recreational fu@@ gi@@ um
&quot; months had been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement near the Little Sea near Em@@ den are lying on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s municipal development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which repro@@ ached the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went on to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; for months , the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; the photos and the new details on the hotel building , which had come to the meeting , produced hef@@ ty reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , a member of the sea and board member of the group of interests of the lieg@@ er , Per H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch over@@ looked by all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears as many other project critics that the traffic would increase considerably due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; all the buses will have to come , so that it is worth it , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still l@@ acked , the development plans were still variable . &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling @-@ funds campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double @-@ donation campaign which aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , has fled from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised to a value of $ 5.5 million to $ 11 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the advantages of losing weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether lightly obes@@ e people live longer with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ went surgical procedure , 36 % of diabetes was completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the type of diabetes was only one percent in comparison with only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mort@@ ality rate in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching major decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete defeat of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who were undergoing obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have strongly connected their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
&quot; it is a theme that is increasingly being noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide also called for an end to violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which devot@@ es himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised German and Austria efforts to get out of the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in taking dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zer , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 were reported to report the poison control centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how te@@ ens dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drow@@ n just because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive frag@@ rances of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; particularly in small children , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Emergency Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es of after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to hospital in an emergency . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is deemed to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors were monitoring them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and threw her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants beyond the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities staff suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as a substance . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York sought to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
the police considered the s@@ worn plan as a &quot; gun &quot; and dism@@ issed disciplinary measures to the school authorities .

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was reported spontan@@ eously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in football is boring Dut@@ ch@@ men - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; at present , de Bo@@ er , an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show any highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; I will spin things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef sw@@ aps to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat of Malm@@ √∂ and the following retirement from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ man out of Aber@@ deen , who now with five points lead clearly to the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the UK@@ s , as shown by the Bureau of National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the occupation in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , there is a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; it could have been better to form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I did . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt of a man from Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to sof@@ ten it sof@@ tly , to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and catch me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of Ben @-@ c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria integrity department , claiming that she was carrying out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt sound sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had with@@ held 18 months for sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and did not want it to look like too high hanging grapes .
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk down the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; prior to that , Moo@@ dy had let the bomb start in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stall . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will appoint - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the view that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L act cow@@ ard@@ ly and makes people outside coaches accoun@@ table for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and drive me out , and I have no doubt that what I say will let you think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer developed with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching said that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ postpon@@ ed Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race @-@ day treatment rule was &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , what pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues was mistaken wearing mud on the leg .
it could have been like last night .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it was also the same on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man under arrest
the police arrested a man following a coll@@ ision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram on the weekend .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with heavy injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia appeared to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is presum@@ ed to be accused of driver acc@@ urs@@ ed and abandoned assistance and for other transport crimes .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations of ring@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees will have allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ Tournam@@ ents &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly concealed reference to the Storm team , after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; model example &quot; &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his team and said they were only concentrating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the critics of two leading trainers in his team were confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; that shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson replied about ring competitions , when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kling a real focus and that has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he played his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like them . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters grew higher than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points a bit more exciting ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet on them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks at the next Saturday evening in the semi@@ fin@@ als at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Serbia with 200,000 $ Dep@@ o@@ sit on Dru@@ gs &quot;
&quot; a man , possibly threatening a lifel@@ ong penalty because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that had been sm@@ ug@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land , was freed up against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that could have been a harmless cause in the caf√© . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; following the reading of the Stat@@ utory Dec@@ lar@@ ations of the two persons it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Serbian passport , noti@@ fying himself on the police daily and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday night . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed in the direction of Basel in front of a permanent site .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain , at the last moment , to do@@ dge to the left , as the police said . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ ist used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ erts instantly her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web research that used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he would have done it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the internet , &quot; and then &quot; dict@@ ated , a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he was addic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people .
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; after his talks with the unknown person , he was asked to send the pictures to him and asked him to send more photos . &quot;
he said he did so to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not to appear before court on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate Adv@@ oc@@ ate Gregor S@@ im asked for H@@ og@@ g to appear not in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; in his disappearance was to be found . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was ref@@ und@@ able in this case , but was held in provisional detention for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was recorded before the date of the sentence into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
hau@@ te switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many lu@@ ke@@ epers left for fear of discovery and arrest people increased to smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and st@@ ow@@ ments to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; in the Munich Central Station , more refugees met again on Wednesday in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people have arrived in the provincial capital alone until 8.00 am , said one spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : runner from Trop@@ enst@@ urm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn from storm o@@ asts in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe current hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart divided . &quot;
&quot; the strong low was the runner @-@ up of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was drag@@ ged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ sea @-@ circle with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ ists at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is primarily a movement in the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations fell to this segment in August alone , according to the German Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17th to 27th September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents a start below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ essi@@ ans offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol can be counted for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door Opel Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what is next to the Astra at the IA@@ A still on new compact cars ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor M√©@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ arm wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact infin@@ ity with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
the model is offered with gasoline engines including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 which is visible at the IA@@ A .
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ √´@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers put their hands on the front part : here , the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , a number of over@@ work and new variants , such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class , or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court released an ex @-@ prisoner of the Jus@@ tiz@@ enship Office Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions in the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court rejected the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and refused the case for renewed scrut@@ iny . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were author@@ itative , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; in April she spoke to a prisoner of compensation , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
un@@ worthy is a 2011 decision as well as the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Verfassungs@@ gerichtshof , which had agreed a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case over three months .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore imprisoned again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even to bat it is said to have come for the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the judicial press , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 should be om@@ itted in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept her .
what to do in Germany ?
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot;
what is coming to Germany will give you the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Transport ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing projects fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable flats will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion euros per year . &quot;
scientists and federal states agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them start their career , &quot; &quot; says Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find out whether they work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says Mig@@ rant researcher Dietrich thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise labor . &quot;
&quot; while there was formerly a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation to asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view prev@@ ailed that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market . &quot;
a major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; so far , there is not yet sufficient offer of general and job @-@ related language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the King &apos;s Way to the Integration Integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School of Education states that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents , it is only once more important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ rob@@ ber of the Berlin School Management . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the studies - the only exception was Berlin , inside sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) , but has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
the admission to the university could be facilit@@ ated .
&quot; for refugees with a burial or d@@ ul@@ ing do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; in general , the latter won &apos;t get a B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g because they do not fall under the circle of potential persons . &quot;
&quot; long@@ standing migrants had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this Spanish course will be short@@ ened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financial gap must be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state law will further develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wohl@@ fahrts@@ verband , who takes care of the new arri@@ vals . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination issue and a general gender equality law for a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , how the NS@@ U murder story showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans require for a long time and for what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism prevention Germany commit , must become a reality in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , &quot; says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be integrated into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requests all newcom@@ ers directly to the registration of health cards . &quot;
the services provided could later be settled with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors mainly do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are more aware of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over not only in clinics , but also in medical offices . &quot;
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; in some other cases , German doctors came from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation and tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system , and several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass tests again . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturb@@ ances , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to avoid that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ologically sick asylum seek@@ ers can offer a request for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege will invite you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to draw all age groups into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the arena on the brick sau@@ cer to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circulation family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior boss . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current &quot; &quot; real estate &quot; &quot; staging . &quot;
Zir@@ kus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
thus the gift of spiritu@@ alizing is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ or@@ boss . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus offers talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ tic C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to easily absorb the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - they identify with these words .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is supposed to conquer female hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with flair and bl@@ iss . &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an is not a problem .
snake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with her flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we do not go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every car@@ ess unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to get into the arena . &quot;
the highest commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , there should be something for that . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and we are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at his ideas every day from 17 to 20 September .
&quot; on Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are discounted . &quot;
it is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
&quot; in the past month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones which warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the leader said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard up to 30,000 jobs will be disman@@ tled &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to turn 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reductions will result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
as a stand @-@ alone company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and is focused on providing so far un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; it spl@@ its a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one has called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to manage the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that close @-@ focused company will perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate an@@ kles wound and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ th@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs to list most of the vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H√©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a little break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s favor@@ ites are to advance by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched during the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , being measured on the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco , and is driven by the distant hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons on male friendship &quot;
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how self @-@ mur@@ dering among young men proves to be on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms pointed out that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy tem@@ per , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ i@@ ke and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently announced , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when soccer matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even if they often hold back to explore their feelings fully . &quot;
&quot; as a colleague of telephone couns@@ elling told me : ... &quot; My hear@@ er role for people who are de@@ pressed and end@@ anger themselves , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed setting to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ √∂ .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to pull PS@@ G , to Malm@@ √∂ . &quot;
here is the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ na Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his champ@@ ions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ at the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut , di Maria found a PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they are not only striving for the kno@@ ck@@ out for the kno@@ ck@@ outs but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals scored . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which was last weekend a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing storm was identified as the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he suggested that when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ √∂ , who suggested Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined with nine national players in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ app posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ carriage and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who killed in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he ordered a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
the second goal was finally shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth seasonal gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thought that Malm@@ √∂ could come back in the game , and only an excellent strip of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before replacing a substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last champ@@ ions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fier cycles are not sufficient . &quot;
hats off Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion $ by shares
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is based in Switzerland , is affected by the collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its huge debt burden plan . &quot;
&quot; the Gl@@ enc@@ ore company , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and dis@@ astro@@ us on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of moving rights brought a rapid increase to the top of London stock exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.9 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced last week the $ 2.5 billion share sale as a part of the more comprehensive plans to wi@@ pe about a third of its $ 30 billion debt , announced . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shares to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns relating to a long @-@ term continued growth in China have decreased iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on September 25 , and re@@ jects President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host the host of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have taken bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President A@@ xis visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden American @-@ Chinese co @-@ operation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will give the opportunity to constructive areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; , &quot; the statement adds . &quot;
&quot; XI , first announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on their way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ sp@@ ying in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China ocean . &quot;

so this also did a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the County of Got@@ ha .
on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt the dream came from and over .
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , ran into the sk@@ id@@ ling on wet road@@ way and drove into the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; obviously a few years ago , the FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , which at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , two times European champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to Qatar for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now adm@@ its that he was standing before the European Championship 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
one told me that Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid did everything , we did nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship .
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; that he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , folded the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King class triumph at the end . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in movies
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Afghan filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not during the cast of the show , &quot; guaranteed Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown was shocked , with ins@@ ult un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian consolidated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white tie . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that &quot; &quot; at the end their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded above Dam@@ on &apos;s comment@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr. Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves movement generated nationwide effect and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to discri@@ minate against discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of movement Black Li@@ ves Matter published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowned first champion
&quot; Pro sports clim@@ ber and manual Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prize of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which has just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could close all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete , who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so completely suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the conductor producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he was the first to finish the course , did not get some prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has got some gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I am glad that Isaac is . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac had felt the same , if they had changed the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for a mixed season , filming will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ps past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins w@@ asted a chance to climb inside a half @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , al@@ beit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word , which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all the victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Em@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inner ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three runners .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ part hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle sailors on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he sw@@ ung the pot@@ tery well , &quot; &quot; said Sel@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a col@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before replacing with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed la@@ f Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run break . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ mont brought the third Bas@@ eman pedal to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe had a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added an insurance @-@ run to Detroit at the end of the ninth inning , wall made a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sty@@ led S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been kn@@ itted before the game from the injury list after he was missing for more than a month because of a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches da in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first one , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third cav@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; in the second , the tig@@ ers made a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big hit , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not feel very well beaten , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter by the reli@@ ever . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a breach of the wor@@ m@@ hole school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ pull , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he was missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three matches in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees will be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted from 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State capital had been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , the government pres@@ idency of Gie@@ √üen has arrived in H@@ esse for the first time . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria one option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the definite thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective appearances . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one would have been happy that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern fron@@ tiers . &quot;
Austrian Minister for Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF . no one is sent back to Hungary .
Germany also returned no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , in which Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it had already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of more 120,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee resistance in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Federal Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection . &quot;
&quot; but who have no perspective , could not stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was strongly divided into the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; enormous effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia during the night on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot;

this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; thus , the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its or@@ bit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this exchange of exchange is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the specialist sheet &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .

&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 M√ºnchen several weeks
the 1860 M√ºnchen has to ren@@ ounce about a month on the offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
&quot; an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , distributed the association . &quot;
R@@ ama was compl@@ aining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to break four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; that is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we must now think , &quot; &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of a united pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a train@@ ee , the six@@ ties initially presented a de@@ ar@@ ant . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was also under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his bra@@ ins , Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie will return to the team training after his bra@@ ins . &quot;
the Austrian national player should already enter the running training on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una D√ºsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a heavy coll@@ ision at the head .
&quot; in spite of his first fears , he remained without a severe cens@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively large amounts of sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B @-@ vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ gan@@ ese but a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; whoever e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant . &quot;
&quot; the shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so green man@@ goes can also taste very tasty . &quot;
you should store at room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
&quot; however , a man@@ go gives a special touch to sav@@ ory dishes . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; for the Christmas business in the USA , the US @-@ parcel service U@@ PS again provides up to 95@@ 0,000 exceptional aids . &quot;
&quot; the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , informed U@@ PS on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are looking for .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95@@ 000 people . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex had previous arrangements since last year to be prepared for Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought a harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first blow @-@ up tower , then marked cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the F@@ √∂h@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland rac@@ ed on Tuesday . &quot;
on wed@@ n@@ esday and on the night for Thursday the fo@@ ehn is partly blown up by the fle@@ eing valleys .
&quot; after F@@ √∂h@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest flow . &quot;
on the north side of the Alps on Wednesday the blow goes through the valleys .
&quot; as a consequence , the blow blows up until Thursday morning in the valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ i country partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ ehn can advance into the adjacent center of the center , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday at a stor@@ my blow for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture starts to st@@ ow at the Alp@@ ens@@ √º@@ d@@ hang . &quot;
here rain burns one that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in sum , the Alps south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with over 100 litres of rain per square meter . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow goes out , as a consequence rolling a cold front with strong , partly hum@@ orous rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind blows strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures rise sharply . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
at Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the Pop@@ es of Pop@@ es could only live in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; with the place , in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a sin@@ less sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions should have reinforced it by historians in his later struggle against Rome .

hammer artists invested in the personal interpretation of the Bible for three years
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works , which Ot@@ mar alt has painted for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs , formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective themes are adjusted , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles , which are subject to themes such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; with this , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler Publ@@ ishers with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the relevant Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar alt and thus translated into the present , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Scrip@@ tures by Martin Luther , and each one of the artist , who wrote his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Or@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the education already took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to re@@ vise this to perhaps also bring me to the Lord &apos;s Father again .
&quot; his second concern is to help art become more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wishes to let the viewers fall into the images , discover them , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the image searches for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost spent on Tuesday presenting the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I did not pay attention to fully compreh@@ ending the Bible , but to select the most important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M√∂@@ h@@ ler of Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M√∂@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , space was found , companies commissioned to model earth@@ works for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; there were failures in politics and administration , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill turned off , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be announced in October , the first common pastor Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; further pause &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga uses a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the football respon@@ ds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and safegu@@ ards its help in cop@@ ing with the problems that arise . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have been holding this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say , that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting to each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; said Mr DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 , Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Ms √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the crucial course must be policy .
&quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some Federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot @-@ sleeves instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We are helping - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen Sports Director Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes to everyone , nobody is allowed to disc@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; we can use football , no , we have to use our jet power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on Friday .
Nier@@ sbach recognized the support of refugees as &quot; a large community network of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 licensing agreements had started their own projects in their own locations , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B @-@ selection and the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach reported . &quot;
reports : head of the Management Board
&quot; the board chief of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , impot@@ ent , then went out to the street - that he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner cited . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully labour @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can pass something like that . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you fell . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except for skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen we@@ ather@@ ed an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; as a reserv@@ ist for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , he will ask for a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : pasture plate in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally crum@@ bled . &quot;
the national player will be absent from the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top Game against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its base eleven at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door ke@@ el position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of regular ke@@ epers Roman B√ºr@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , whether femin@@ ist in the future will be used in all Europa League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;

I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robot &apos;s cars : government wants a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; new mobility era &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt .
&quot; automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who are also coming together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio broadcasting . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; so that the driver &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; the Federal Government wants to examine the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when driving automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically feasible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , car @-@ free vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see more skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; after a survey of the Digital Union &apos;s Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to take control throughout the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , this could mean 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current status of the title battle of 25 September to 4 October , the D√ºsseldorf trade fair wants to open only in singles . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said the German Bundestag J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf , during the European Championships in D√ºsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the set@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; back then Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; that is why we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; explained the World In@@ tran@@ g@@ ist Fi@@ fth . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has pulled out a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ ant !
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , from 18 September onwards , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; he was actually against it , for : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ographer &apos;s total work , for which a lot of effort was done : to refresh the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
14 tons of material have bar@@ red the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , timi@@ d fashion design of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later contributed to designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later , of course I bought them . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they could keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as a fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around th@@ aw@@ ing to make meters .
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning times of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze Mode played a greater role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is le@@ aning on past bull po@@ ets , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who serves no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already do half of all orders . &quot;
charity Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they can carry the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
there are almost no more private specialty stores and the wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ ware is much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; moreover , exports , currently export@@ ing to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also attempts to score by environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le explained in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outer enst@@ elle of the West@@ s√§chs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the businesses that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ cks small balls at some places . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ ths master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ zer was inspired by it : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ auen tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures to a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; is not about re @-@ screening but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; but the director already stands out : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI seeks to open the economy broader for the world
&quot; the economy must open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Command Council for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list for regul@@ ating market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population register system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not ques@@ tioning for investments . &quot;
the system is tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and making the market more open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on powers assigned to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activities and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury border value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a much higher dose of the drugs .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ Watch , who has a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects neglected industrial and environmental policy will be passed on with full impact on pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ Watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ti@@ ghten the limit values in other fish@@ ings from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ Watch , however , described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the reduction in plain @-@ fish is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver , which only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which accum@@ ulates over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; small quantities of particularly in un@@ born damages of the nervous system &quot; &quot; can cause . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants cast more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; , &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March of paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
Food@@ Watch calls for consumers to protest against EU &apos;s plans at : www.@@ qu@@ mer@@ cury @-@ tion@@ .@@ food@@ watch@@ .de
