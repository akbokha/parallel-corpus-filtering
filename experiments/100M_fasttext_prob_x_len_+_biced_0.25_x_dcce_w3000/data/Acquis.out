C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organisation are arranged in such a manner that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disturb@@ ance for the community and the states and for those peaceful nuclear activities are as small as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the Organization for knowledge of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; every state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the provisions of the Agreement on the Privileg@@ es and Liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures following this agreement are termin@@ ated with regard to core material , if the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
the Community noti@@ fies the organization according to the provisions of this Convention the transfer of core material from the States which is subject to the security measures following this Convention .
&quot; the securing measures following this agreement are termin@@ ated with regard to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents , from which each passing and if necessary the re@@ use of the backup measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; in order to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the Community with the organization is to be used by the organisation of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated according to this agreement in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives during the duration of the non @-@ application of the security measures .
B ) The organization and the community meet a regulation that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall not be applied as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organisation is kept on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of the material contained in the concerned state or the states concerned and on any transmission of such material from this state or states .
&quot; this explains their agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include an endor@@ sement or a knowledge of the military activity , and does not refer to the subsequent use of the nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their authority , however , are subject to extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , so the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs , as long as they are in advance in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of implementing this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or a state against the organization or the organization against the community or the organization , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , is governed by the implementation of the security measures following this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; according to the advice given by the General Director , the Council shall verify that the organization must not be able to verify that no nuclear material which must be subject to safety measures , for nuclear weapons or other core explosive bodies , can then reimbur@@ se the reports envis@@ aged in Article X@@ II paragraph C and if necessary , also the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been acquired by the measures applied by the applied safety measures , provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is affected - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations will take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are examined by the Council .
the Council invites the Community and the affected state to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes , a statement issued by the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council shall be lod@@ ged by any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which shall not be included in the negotiation process or by another of the organization , the Community and the States , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states name two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth , who pres@@ ides over the chair@@ manship . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty @-@ three days , the community or organisation can request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure shall be applied if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ration court are binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention appears for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention and &quot;
II ) if the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that they are able to apply their security measures to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
&quot; a ) The organization , the Community and the States consult one another on request one of the contracting parties about a change of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director informs all member states of the organization immediately from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention comes into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties of the Treaty are .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the necessary procedures as necessary in carrying out the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the procedures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bi@@ fur@@ cation of significant amounts of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a branch through the risk of early discovery .
&quot; for the enrich@@ ment of the destination defined in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a safety measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial interference and observation as important complementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which material quantity which is not proven for a certain period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified measured values . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their tests , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the securing system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their security measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following methods and they , as far as required , will see how they are near@@ er to the supple@@ menting agreements and are appropriate : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the amounts of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or in other ways from the continu@@ ance of far away core material and inventory levels ; &quot;
B ) assessment of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures to evaluate accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes of this inventory including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) precau@@ tions , which ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are executed correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or in the ore preparation .
&quot; B ) ur@@ anium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ inal material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , entered into the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not implemented specifically for non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ting , or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the States , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ ards provided in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not permitted , the association is not possible or desired from resi@@ dues , the organisation and community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is rep@@ aid , and &quot;
&quot; Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which lies over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures following this agreement , from these security measures , provided the entire core material quantity liber@@ ated in the United States at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) 20 metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; if the core material is to be delivered or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures following this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are required in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention , in the individual , as the procedures defined in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supple@@ menting agreements can be extended or amended without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the extension of this agreement will take effect simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the consent between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in article 62 , the organization provides a summary inventory of the whole , the securing measures of this Convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory according to the following reports and the results of their review . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation , in order to help the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by generic res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ed problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States , that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mid @-@ ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the Organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table that is inten@@ tionally intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds provided by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to by the organization as ste@@ ward trust@@ ee , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest debt of the Member State , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the concerned state as ste@@ wards of the special transaction account and to post@@ p@@ one in the rear leg@@ alisation of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two rates ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the Administr@@ ative appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administr@@ ators under consideration of the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may be able to pay the payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker will take some proportional draw on the cash or the school notes in order to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and compens@@ ate the special transaction account appropriately . &quot;
&quot; in gran@@ ting this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors under the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
III ) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit absorption capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices that are financed by the organization funded by the Organization , whereby the objective of the agreement is to be taken into account in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the Bank or Organisation &apos;s directors on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special action loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions which are valid for the organization granted by the Organisation ; they are therefore rep@@ aid in ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are pay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that re@@ tains them .
&quot; every action loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which in particular the origin of the means is given . &quot;
&quot; income from any special transaction loan may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or rendered . ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are and those according to what the administrators appointed at the time of loan loss , may be recipients of a special action loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans are made on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state shall be transferred to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator to the relevant Member State . &quot;
the Administr@@ ators are instruc@@ ted until the E@@ EC has approved the E@@ EC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors through the directors approved by the directors and by the directors approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker advis@@ es the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses for this purpose . &quot;
the manager transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible following the conclusion of the financial year of the organisation an extensive billing of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the Managing Director of the E@@ EC shall soon submit a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions paid to the special transaction account , which are depos@@ ited from the account recei@@ pts to the account depos@@ ited and depos@@ ited out of the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administr@@ ators until the complete publication of the funds from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes funded by special action plans , and about all other issues related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organisation agreed , did not enter into force , the agreement and all the resulting commitments of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount of all recei@@ vers used by the recei@@ vers is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement and returned to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting commitments of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval from the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a notification on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the aforementioned noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ cri@@ pts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 is to be concluded between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ AG@@ EM@@ ENT :

&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of human resources exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is one of the joint vent@@ ures of J@@ ET with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become a contract partner of any contract , with its objective in the scope of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the governing bodies , which are mand@@ ated to carry out the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , is the sub@@ stitution of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research , and to direct the best possible outcomes in line with the goals of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates at the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom Programme , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; V@@ G . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is taking this task in terms of all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and sets its T * level in the interests of both parties to the common goal defined in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in Article 1 of the present agreement , with respect to the scientific and technological developments outlined in the world . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the responsible Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the couns@@ elling groups , which provided the V@@ G research proposals for the funding granted for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in regard to all research and development work , which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the directors of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the committee &apos;s committee to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for the capacity of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out in the framework of the program , authori@@ zes this task with regard to all research and development work , which fall under the present agreement . &quot;

agreement in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial state
&quot; the BIS could conclude Stand@@ by credit lines with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks submit a corresponding request . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could be concluded by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , and within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are called , to which application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; at each stand @-@ by @-@ credit , the BI@@ Z would initially take an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the event of the opening of the loans , as well as on the extended extension , the BIS would charge a credit @-@ bill commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first draw would not be made prior to the exp@@ iry of a month after the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BIS at the agreement of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time considering the funds of the Bank , presum@@ ably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who used the BI@@ Z at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ Z has to obtain the necessary funds on the market , the interest rate could reach a maximum , which is equivalent to a corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

&quot; constitutional Compl@@ aint in the &quot; &quot; M@@ oll@@ ath Case &quot; &quot; Succ@@ ess@@ ful &quot;
&quot; considering the reasons : the agreement made by UNESCO on the import of objects of educational , scientific or cultural character - the so @-@ called agreement of Florence - is intended to promote free circulation of books , publications and objects of educational , scientific or cultural character . &quot;
&quot; at the 19th session of the UNESCO General Conference of 26 November 1976 , a protocol to the agreement of Florence was adopted to grant customs clearance for a number of objects that were excluded from this agreement , even though it is considered a complement to the agreement as an agreement to be considered by this agreement . &quot;
the provisions of the protocol with the objectives of the European Economic Community agree to appro@@ ve this protocol with the objectives of the European Economic Community . it is therefore recommended to appro@@ ve this protocol with the explanations provided in number 16 ( a ) .
&quot; ( 1 ) The Protocol of 26 November 1976 on the agreement on import@@ ing objects , scientific or cultural character is approved in the name of the European Economic Community . &quot;

&quot; the conclusion of the Convention by the Community brings - without prejudi@@ ce to the legal acts , which it subsequently leaves - no expansion of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Community . &quot;
&quot; because of the particular situation of Greenland with regard to the natural conditions of the country and the living conditions of the local population , Greenland should be exemp@@ ted from the scope of the Convention - &quot;
the Convention on the Conservation of the migration of wild animals is approved in the name of the European Economic Community .
&quot; the President of the Council depos@@ ited the document on accession in accordance with Article X@@ VII of the Convention for the Territ@@ ories , in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied according to the provisions of the Treaty , with the exception of Greenland . &quot;

&quot; in the consciousness that every generation of mankind manages the natural assets of the Earth for the coming generations , and is committed to ensuring that this legacy is preserved and where it is used , the use is carried out in a pru@@ dent way ; &quot;
&quot; conden@@ sed of the ever @-@ growing value of wild animals from environmentally @-@ related , ecological , genetic , scientific , aesthetic , free @-@ time @-@ related , cultural , educational , social and economic point of view ; &quot;
&quot; in particular care for those species of wild animals , hikes across national jurisdiction boundaries or outside the same companies ; &quot;
&quot; in the realization that the states are the prot@@ ectors of the wander@@ ing animal species and must be , who live or cross it in their national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; in the conviction that conservation and effective lifting and use of wander@@ ing animal species require common measures of all states , in whose national jurisdiction these types spend a part of their life cycle ; &quot;
the recommendation 32 of the United Nations Conference on the Environment of People ( Stockholm 1972 ) adopted and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly with satisfaction to the knowledge taken by the UN General Assembly -
&quot; ( 1 ) In the sense of this Convention , &quot; wander@@ ing species &quot; means the total population or a ge@@ ographi@@ cally defined partial population of any species or any lower taxes of wild animals , of which an important portion is cy@@ c@@ lic and fores@@ ee@@ able one or more national jurisdiction boundaries ; &quot;
B ) means &quot; conservation situation of a wander@@ ing way &quot; the enti@@ rety of the in@@ flu@@ ence of this migration which could affect their long @-@ term spread and population growth ;
&quot; C ) the &quot; &quot; preservation situation &quot; &quot; is regarded as &quot; &quot; favourable &quot; &quot; if 1 . information on population dynamics indicate that the mig@@ rating species asser@@ ts itself in the long term as a viable component of its ecos@@ ystems ; &quot;
&quot; 2 . the spread @-@ area of the wander@@ ing way is not reduced either matur@@ ely , nor seen in the long @-@ term , in future is threatened ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . whether present as well as in the fores@@ ee@@ able future , there is sufficient habitat to preserve the population of the wander@@ ing species in the long term . &quot;
&quot; 4 . the spread and population size of the wander@@ ing nature of the wander@@ ing nature approaches the historical circumstances by extension and gir@@ th in a mass , in which potentially suitable ecos@@ ystems are present and that is to be agreed with a sensible he@@ ge and use ; &quot;

&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , the import duties for these new Member States shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is determined with the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of batt@@ lefield weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order to prevent the shipments of frozen meat to frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb meat as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be consider@@ ate at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by providing quantities of export lic@@ ences specified within this agreement for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;

the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the individual products can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in accordance with the regulations , the competent Argent@@ ine authority responsible for the responsible position of the Community in regular intervals has been given the amounts for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to the destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and runs smoothly .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the global market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are of significance for that of the number 7 . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I ad@@ ore myself to take the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define provisions on import@@ ing H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from New Zealand into the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of amm@@ el - and lamb meat after the world market and in particular after the Community of New Zealand &apos;s economy , must be ensured that the normal paragraph of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat on these markets is not affected , I honor the following agreements : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat is guaranteed to access to the Community market in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives assurance that the normal paragraph of his mam@@ mot@@ h - and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the set @-@ up amount does not exceed the stipul@@ ated quantity . &quot;
the pre @-@ assembled quantities are carried out in traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented with this agreement to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position in the community of the community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community takes the protection clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products covered by this agreement to a host of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities established in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , the import charges for these new Member States shall be taken into account in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession . &quot;
the total amount stated in clause 2 will be set with the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 245 500 tons of slaughter body weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order to prevent the shipments of frozen meat to frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of this objective . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties undertake everything in order to promote the consumption of meat in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb meat as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular that there are no export licenses beyond these quantities .
&quot; the community also comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is determined by the submission of an export license , which is given by the authority appointed by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the individual products can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in accordance with the regulations , the competent authority of the Authority of the Community of the Community in regular intervals stipul@@ ates the quantities necessary for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to the destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and the g@@ ing@@ i@@ val market of both parties and on the global market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified for the purpose of clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat under the agreement are not carried out under the agreement of the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall be un@@ affected by the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount set in clause 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , as well as for the main area of New Zealand on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will take effect on 20 October 1980 . following this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement are reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 in terms of changes they are necessary for . &quot;

&quot; containers and inf@@ usion devices are provided prior to shipping with a label set in English and French , which corresponds to the pattern contained in the systems 2 to 10 . &quot;
&quot; human whole blood may only be sent in containers , in which the temperature can be kept to 4 C to 6 C during the whole transport . &quot;
&quot; the preparations and devices mentioned in part II of this protocol must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ che@@ ated and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the equipment required for inf@@ usion , as well as the solv@@ ents for dry preparations . &quot;
human whole blood is taken from a healthy man and ming@@ led with a suitable anti @-@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; C ) the diseases which are not free of blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; the blood is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is em@@ itted by a closed , sterile tube system into a sterile bottle , in which the anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ elled before steri@@ li@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; once the blood is finished , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , it may only be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution may not amount to more than 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not decrease 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined by hand of the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is done by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use if specific studies have shown the absence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot;
the blood replaced after this agreement should only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human whole blood is stored in sterile , closed bottle in front of micro @-@ organisms and can hold up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during the time for testing and transport , which is allowed to cool down to 4 to 6 C. &quot;
a concentration of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred blood from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells should amount between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; if an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , the label also has its volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human drying plasma is obtained by drying the liquid , which is depos@@ ited in centri@@ fu@@ g@@ ation or sedi@@ mentation of human whole blood . &quot;
the human drying plasma is obtained by cold @-@ drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a water quantity , which corresponds to the quantity of liquids , from which the substance was produced . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the so @-@ called solution may not amount to less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not have any visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) have been observed a dangerous content of in@@ sole poly@@ mer@@ sin or immune hem@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine are excluded .
&quot; if plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transfer of I@@ no@@ kul@@ ations@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis , there are mix@@ tures that are not included in plasma concentrations , which do not contain more than 12 donations , or apply other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the amount of liquids , from which one went off during the production of plasma , must be applied ; the substance must be completely detached from 15 to 20 C within 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which is the amount of fluid produced from which it is made ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; if one uses a sufficient quantity of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de 1 ml of solution , co@@ ag@@ ulation is carried out ; the process can be accelerated at 37 ° C in the brood @-@ furnace . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of less than 0.@@ 02 mm mer@@ cury , weight loss of less than 0.5 % may not occur in the human dry plasma . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is in a nitrogen atmosphere or in the air @-@ empty space in a sterile , closed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and after the possibility of storing any moisture ; it is protected from light and to keep on a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions from human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component , which consist of about 60 % of the total proteins of the human whole blood . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether the final product should be fluid or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C after supple@@ menting a suitable stabili@@ zer in order to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ kul@@ ations@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be Alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G can be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the end product is freeze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the fraction is made from human plasma proteins as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per litre . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ ina is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per litre . &quot;
&quot; comparative measurements of vis@@ cosity and clou@@ d@@ iness as well as centri@@ fu@@ ging with the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis , which are made before and after the heating of the solutions , may not result in den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins . &quot;

&quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all blood samples tested , containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the way recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ tre is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely for volume of blood circulation in total volume .
&quot; in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object toler@@ ances , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has established International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents , and re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are worked out at the time of standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in single preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally observed in a series of di@@ lution in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te force .
the Tit@@ ans speci@@ fies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series in which a micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination , present for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International standard prepar@@ ate or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;

the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label lies at most a year after the last satisfying efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
&quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 v.@@ H. of its weight , if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) can be added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the agent continues with the added substance to the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ plen@@ ished ser@@ um .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain any sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange of blood groups should not be dy@@ ed arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least as long as an international Convention on a unified system has come about . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that it is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all production stages and controls of re@@ agents for blood group identification written records .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents needed are so long to keep from the laboratory until some probability can be assumed that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their active part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each container , a black printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; in THE survey that the Community has decided within the action programme to strengthen the internal market , as of January 1 , 1988 , to introduce a uniform man@@ ag@@ erial paper in the internal market of goods , &quot;
&quot; in DER Er@@ v@@ eg@@ ung , that it is appropriate to simplify the trade of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the various EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a uniform managing paper , &quot;
&quot; in THE survey , that this Convention may not be interpreted in detail , that it ent@@ ails the contractual parties of its obligations from other international conventions - &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to facilitate the in@@ conveni@@ ences of goods traffic between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform man@@ ag@@ erial paper ( herein@@ after referred to as Regulation ) is introduced , which is un@@ affected by the type and origin of goods for all export and import processes as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to below ) . &quot;
the in@@ conveni@@ ences associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are fu@@ elled by means of a single unit to use the pre @-@ printed pattern in Anne@@ x I to this Convention .
&quot; depending on the case , the unit paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - in order to carry out the legislation valid in a contracting party , its application would not be guaranteed in case of sole use of the unit of consent ; &quot;
- to be requested by the parties so that they may be able to come to the enjoyment of a prefer@@ ential part or a particular relief .
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contracting parties , simplified procedures , also using data processing , in terms of further facil@@ itation for those involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In@@ cre@@ ased proceedings may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the relevant goods are not to be submitted to a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , an application must subsequently be filed in which the competent authorities may act by a peri@@ odic filing of the collection within which the deadline stipul@@ ated by these authorities shall be submitted . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use it instead of using a uniform distributor . &quot;

&quot; - to allow the competent authorities to enter the data required to obtain the relevant data in their data processing systems for the treatment of the applicant , and if necessary without giving a written application ; &quot;
&quot; - to allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , that the export , mail@@ - or import announcement either by the unit created by this system or if such a paper is not created by entering the data into the data processing system ; &quot;
&quot; - Fac@@ il@@ itations to apply , which were adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions governing the provision of goods required for export , shipping and import of goods are laid down in Anne@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the pre@@ prints listed in the Anne@@ x I , are listed in the App@@ endi@@ x III to this Convention . &quot;
( 1 ) The registration is to be made in one of the Official Langu@@ ages of the Parties authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the authorities will be entitled to export or shipping .
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the destination country or transit country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Un@@ devi@@ ating from paragraph 1 , the registration is always to be made in one of the official languages of the import country if it occurs in this country by using other than the copy of the import or exp@@ iry date of the registration . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative can only use the registration copies required for each individual process period between the contracting parties , which , if necessary , can be attached to the necessary copies required to obtain the findings in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on gather@@ ings , however , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the in@@ conveni@@ ences for the export and shipping process can be obtained on one and the same advance by means of the specimens provided for these festivities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities will be able to agree , as far as possible , that the information contained in the samples issued in the individual processing sections shall be consistent . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth flow of goods between the contracting parties and to the facil@@ itation of the un@@ certain@@ ties or conc@@ essions , the customs authorities of these countries place one another on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative aid may be wholly or partially denied or rejected , if the sought @-@ after country of view is that the ministers would compromise his security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests , or viol@@ ate a business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In case of refusal or rejection of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and their grounds for the seeking land shall be notified un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking assistance , which could not afford it , if it would be searched for it , it points in its search for this circum@@ stance . &quot;
( 5 ) The information received after paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention and will enjoy the protection which the country &apos;s internal law that it has received is granted for information of this type .
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which has given them , and are subject to the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) A mixed committee is used , in which each contracting party is represented by the Convention . &quot;

1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee has the task to ad@@ minister this Convention and to ensure its proper application .
&quot; for this purpose , the committee is regularly informed about practical experience with the application of the Convention ; he speaks recommendations and summ@@ ari@@ zes in cases of paragraph 3 decisions . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee resol@@ ves amendments to the annex@@ es to this Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party accepted a decision under the reservation of the constitutional requirements , the decision is accepted , if no date is called , on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party makes appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this agreement , whereby the need to be taken into account is to disman@@ tle the goods that are charged with goods traffic and to carry out outstanding solutions arising from the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the areas of the EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
( 2 ) This Agreement shall also apply to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the Princip@@ ality of the Swiss Con@@ federation is connected to the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union agreement .
&quot; any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with a twelve month period ; written notice is to be directed to the de@@ posit@@ ary mentioned in Article 17 , which noti@@ fies them to all other contractual parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , insofar as the contractual parties have depos@@ ited their acceptance documents by the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities by 1 November 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , so it enters into force on the first day of the second month . &quot;
&quot; this Convention is written in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Italian , Dutch , Norwegian , Swedish , and Spanish . &quot;
I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for a cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , herein@@ after referred to as the Commission , can ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Council , &quot; in order to ask recommendations concerning the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will follow this wish as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . coun@@ ten@@ ance of the Commission &apos;s responsibility in issues of management of fish stocks , the Council agrees to present all relevant reports of its working groups to assess the stock situation and the reports of its advisory fish@@ eries committee . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly advise on how the cooperation between the two parties can be intensi@@ fied , and in particular investigate the opportunities provided by the Commission to establish a closer link to the Advisory Board of F@@ ish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 4 . in the signature of this agreement , the community will pay a total of 3@@ 76 000 d@@ k@@ r and then pay annual payments . &quot;
the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings which are conven@@ ed at special request of the Commission .
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties shall be re @-@ examined again . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement extends on the basis of the existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
every party has at all times the se@@ ag@@ ity to withdraw from the agreement with respect to a one @-@ year period of notice .
&quot; with regard to clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognize the observer status at meetings of the Advisory Committee on F@@ ish@@ eries Management . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask the word and participate in the meetings , but would not have a voting right and also not the possibility to change the agen@@ das of the meetings . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would let me know if these agreements are acceptable as the basis of a cooperation between your council and the community for you .
I expect this letter and your response to the agreement on cooperation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community .

the parties of the agreement signed in Brussels on 15 December 1950 on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the field of customs
&quot; it is desirable that on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on the harmon@@ ised system for the designation and enco@@ ding of goods enters into force on January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE survey , that without a change in Article 13 of the Convention , the time of the entry into force of the Convention would remain uncertain - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the international agreement concluded on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the harmon@@ ised system of designation and enco@@ ding of the goods , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; paragraph 1 will receive the following version : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention will come into force on 1 January , which is followed immediately after the exp@@ iry of at least three months , to which at least sev@@ ent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ites signed the Convention without reservation of the rati@@ fication or have depos@@ ited their rati@@ fication or accession accounts , but not before January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; A.

&quot; however , only States or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists can post@@ p@@ one the certificate of acceptance of this Protocol , which have previously signed the Convention without reservation of the rati@@ fication or at the same time sign or submit its document on the rati@@ fication or the accession to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B. Any State and any Cust@@ oms or Economic Union , the contracting party of the Convention after the entry into force of this protocol in accordance with paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version . &quot;
&quot; a plant that is indispensable not only for the entertainment and maintenance of so@@ ils , but also allows the use of land that makes no other planting possible , which makes the main part of today &apos;s production , favourable to any improvement in cultivation methods . &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DAR@@ AU@@ F , that its cultivation depend@@ ed on the existence and living standards of millions of families , which , in turn , depend entirely on the measures that are made to maintain and expand the consumption of olive products in the producers of producers themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DAR@@ AU@@ F , that olive oil and table oli@@ ven represent essential raw materials in the areas where the olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DAR@@ AU@@ F , that the essential characteristic of olive production is the in@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supplies , and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producers ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DAR@@ AU@@ F , that this creates all special difficulties which seriously damage the interests of producers and consumers and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the general policies of economic growth in the countries where the olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; among H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F the extraordinary significance of olive production for the economy of many countries , especially in the development of olive growing countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DAR@@ AU@@ F , that in view of the particular conditions of olive growing and the market for olive products required measures to go beyond national borders and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
&quot; in view of the international olive oil Convention of 1956 in its amended version , as well as the International O@@ live Oil Convention of 1963 in its multiple extended and amended version and the International olive oil Convention of 1979 ; &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M BE@@ W@@ US@@ ST@@ SE@@ IN , that it is essential to continue and further develop the work carried out within the framework of the above Convention , and that it is desirable to conclude a new agreement - &quot;
the goals of the International Convention of 1986 on olive oil and table oli@@ ven ( in the following as :
&quot; to consider the provisions of resolutions 93 ( IV ) , 124 ( V ) and 155 ( VI ) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the following are : &quot;
B ) maintain adequate working conditions in olive growing and in the olive industry to raise the standard of living of populations ;
&quot; to promote the co @-@ ordination of the production , industri@@ alization and market policy for olive oil , olive oil and table oli@@ ven and the organization of the market for these products ; &quot;
d ) to examine and facilitate the use of the necessary measures in respect of the remaining products of the olive tree ;
&quot; to reduce the production costs of the products made from it , especially the olive oil , to improve the position of this oil on the overall market for fluid vegetable oils , &quot;
IV ) to improve the situation of the olive industry in relation to the environment in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Environment of Hum@@ ans in order to remedy any nu@@ is@@ ance ;
&quot; a ) to facilitate the investigation and application of measures to increase international trade with olive products to increase the means that the producers , in particular those in development , achieve , increase and accelerate their economic growth and their social development taking into account the interests of consumers ; &quot;
B ) to meet all measures suitable to extend the consumption of olive oil and table oli@@ ves ;
&quot; C ) to prevent any practices of unfair competition in international trade with olive oil , olive oil and table oli@@ ven , and to fight , if necessary , and to guarantee the delivery of goods . &quot;
&quot; d ) to improve the market access and reliability of supply , market structures and marketing , distribution and promotion systems ; &quot;
&quot; e ) to undertake all activities and measures , which are suitable to issue the organic value of olive oil and table oli@@ ven ; &quot;

&quot; den@@ ying that the Executive Board approved the need for the Convention on its second meeting to effectively reduce the annual total emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from stationary and movable sources or their gr@@ en@@ ching flow until 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions , to maintain and review their emissions limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and impacts of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their follow @-@ up products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions , &quot;
&quot; to take effective measures to combat and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ ching flow , especially by applying appropriate national emissions limits for new mobile site @-@ fixed sources as well as by upgra@@ ding existing large @-@ scale sources , &quot;
&quot; in the realization that scientific and technical knowledge about these issues further develop and that this development is to be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol , and in deciding on further measures , &quot;
&quot; in the realization that the preparation of a solution based on critical stresses is the creation of an effective scientific basis for the purpose of taking into account the application of this protocol and in deciding on further internationally agreed measures , &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; taking note of satisfaction that several states have under@@ gone each other to reduce their annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des in@@ secure and considerable scale , &quot;
