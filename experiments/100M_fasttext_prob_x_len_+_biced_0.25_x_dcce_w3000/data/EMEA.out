&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. cha@@ otic thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder in which the patients have some normal mood altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for preventing man@@ ic episodes in patients that have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the enam@@ el tablets in patients who are preparing the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are also degra@@ ded as A@@ bili@@ ti@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l helps norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their re@@ occurrence . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent re@@ occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours versus plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occurrence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , alter@@ ing the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bits the melting tablets and the solution for inser@@ ting .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ ti@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness compared to patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder reduced A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks as plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal disturb@@ ances ( un@@ controlled traction ) , tre@@ mor ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ ti@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and moderate man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disturb@@ ance , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mostly in man@@ ic episodes , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . approval for the import of A@@ bili@@ ti@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and has been reported in some cases after the onset or change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; when symptoms and symptoms of a sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with abili@@ fy , consider reducing the dose or canc@@ elling the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to an M@@ n or has un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es , with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , respectively , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l around 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ is@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the shared gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage level before starting the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproduction studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of eps was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of eps was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of eps was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of eps was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of eps 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tionally acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma mass . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disturb@@ ance via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
&quot; with a dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ c @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 of the respon@@ dents who contributed to the study media were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ ate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disturb@@ ance Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disturb@@ ance Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a preservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also pointed out a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic response , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ strate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zing phase before Rand@@ om@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a decline in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at almost 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different radi@@ al cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions , which have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3- to 10@@ times of middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a Ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3@@ fold of the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l no more than 6 % of the concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty when swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets can take the enam@@ tablets alternatively to abili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after the onset or change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients , who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of eps was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disturb@@ ance via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disturb@@ ance Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form for healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 In addition , a Ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3@@ fold of the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of diet and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by hu@@ dd@@ ling adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy melting tablets or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with diet and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was larger compared to that after only a dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as a mal@@ function intr@@ amus@@ cular and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist fam@@ ot@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage level before starting the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cular , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was larger compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo , or were classified in clinical trials with oral @-@ to @-@ use Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of eps was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of eps was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of eps 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as well @-@ being and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of the Agi@@ on and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the average improvement from bas@@ eline value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe absorption , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 of the respon@@ dents who contributed to the study media were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study enzi@@ ed &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic response , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ strate . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in man@@ ic patients , who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a decline in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after giving the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time for achieving the maximum plasma level is 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity of intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns arose after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ st@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions , which have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10 times of medium steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a Ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times of recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses which lead to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold medium steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a study in which 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drugs contained in a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , patients responded to the treatment versus 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients that have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ony ground in the blood before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; the Medic@@ inal Medic@@ ines Committee ( CH@@ MP ) stated that in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , there was no need to be treated with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transfer of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced in subsequent series to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in sensor@@ ic N@@ europ@@ athy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted , until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ layer formulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in the patient , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ini@@ ties have risen again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly identified cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , kar@@ mic incidents in the indicated patient collective are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in the case of patients following the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ tious methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to do no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to the treatment via a sperm infection because the therapy with abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important cases of adverse events , which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated blood sugar , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease : &quot;

&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , head@@ ache , pain pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , f@@ lange pain , dis@@ comfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
&quot; since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules which promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ans and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ formation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ ose of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ant protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour .
&quot; the application of abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ armed , un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III comparison study . &quot;
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ e study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without medi@@ ating ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % due to metast@@ as@@ ation and 19 % due to metast@@ as@@ ation and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree of patients experienced at a time during therapy an peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to end sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30 and 180 minutes of abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentr@@ ates decreased in a multi@@ phase way . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or gra@@ zing band@@ aging of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the clearance of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary secre@@ tion of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data were available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood fer@@ rous values , in which blood trans@@ fusion complications could occur if there is a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be taken under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received an appropriate instruction . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are controlled before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ emia , or that the body does not sufficiently respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an injection in a vein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a v@@ ene as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from the an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a vein before they were either converted to se@@ amed amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of exposure under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients who suffered an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were kept in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce medicinal products P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the in@@ stig@@ ation of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( i.e. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , in case of planned greater operative interventions , which require large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be used that cannot participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall condition ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed on or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
clinical results suggest that patients with initial low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
clinical results suggest that patients with very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall condition ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for the control of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg , ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.00@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction rate increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood accounts is required , should be obtained twice a week in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed treatment .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( tag 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the cycle . &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ine at a ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia or PR@@ CA ) should not get a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently received heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA according to monthly and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , should be investigated and the usual causes of non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ ous toxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are determined , and if no other reason of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of bone marks for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
in clinical studies an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit which is due to the dose of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ines when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration increases the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ dently cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ine response should be taken into account ( patients who may need to be trans@@ founded ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to reduce the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction , taking part in the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure , if possible , prior to ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should have an appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , because they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that for treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with an initial weight of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces may exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy alone when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumour tissue , there are no indications of an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ em@@ ias , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content , identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients . &quot;
&quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and not influenced the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omes , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ mot@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ ch@@ yn@@ ous tum@@ ors , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;

survival and tumor progression were examined in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine patients and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine were consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to a number of frequent mal@@ ign@@ omas , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value less than 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data . &quot;
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin &apos;s ser@@ um levels are much lower than the amount of ser@@ um levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the final dose . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated three years with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal studies with approxim@@ ate the 20@@ x of the recommended daily dose , ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased f@@ ö@@ tal body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to a rise in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , but which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a maximum of 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings , and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label so that if necessary , the measurement of partial amounts is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the indications mentioned above .

increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omes , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ mot@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ ch@@ yn@@ ous tum@@ ors , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 149 In animal experimental studies with approxim@@ ate the 20@@ x of the recommended daily dose , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa led to decreased f@@ ö@@ tal body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to a rise in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a maximum of 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; prior to the market launch and agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the holder of approval for the in@@ hibition has to provide the medical professional staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Educational brochures • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the correct application of the product , provided refriger@@ ators for transport through the patients . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the permit is to ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and is fully functional before the drug is put into circulation , and as long as the drug is used in circulation . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the in@@ hibition is committed to the trials and additional measures listed in the Phar@@ mak@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as defined in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. as well as to each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan adopted by CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for the human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ fulness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • on receipt of new information , the influence on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures for risk reduction may be made within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) &quot;
&quot; • If you have suffered a heart attack or stroke during a month before your treatment , if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( appearing for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of blood graf@@ ting occurs in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ) , for example , when such a blood @-@ pf@@ rop@@ ho@@ e occurred . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe bleeding disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ) , you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells within the normal range , which re@@ builds itself in further treatment . &quot;
your doctor may carry out regular blood tests if necessary to control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid , should be considered and treated before the onset of therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rarely has been reported on the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ yst according to monthly and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin of spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of the blood arm with ab@@ norm@@ als in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dosage accordingly to keep the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully to the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , especially if you are an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces have occurred ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bo@@ li@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ y@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can influence the tumor negative . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get abor@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines / used / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are a means of building the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood@@ bath ( an@@ a@@ emia ) appeals to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests if necessary , in order to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are well adjusted , you receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests if necessary , in order to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to sh@@ orten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones spr@@ inkle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of H@@ inf@@ ants ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of up to five years . &quot;
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two trials of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood is norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures in people under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta , with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ asta side effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( canc@@ ers of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta &apos;s manufacturer provides educational material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis which contains evidence of how to apply the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transportation of A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The Pack@@ ages supplement • Con@@ trac@@ tions in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year . &quot;
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , since bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people of A@@ cl@@ asta will not be recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are missing for convenience and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated before starting treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with an appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental handles , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ illary area . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta was increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the total frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ ired drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid was associated with kidney function disorders that expressed itself as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ atine clearance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on evaluating the findings of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently released hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses occ@@ uring in the max@@ illary area , especially for cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the max@@ illary area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
7 study of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ illary area of one treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fluid . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of spinal fluid compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta proved a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures at a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density at lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ rate acid , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , of the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone structure .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) is the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
the effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment by BM@@ D at all points of time and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all times .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta treatment carried out over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total , and by 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , primarily light to moderate mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.1 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; after 6 months , the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain and pain intensity compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as a respon@@ der at the end of the six month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 patients participating in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ ically independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bar quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi @-@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages of the distribution ( α and β ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the inf@@ usion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans , and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabol@@ ised inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the ch@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance , and in the 64 examined patients in the medium 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require the dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; because for severe ren@@ al dys@@ functions ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute Tox@@ ic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies in dogs , individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6 times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) have been administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was administered by rats in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the four@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use of accumulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an aug@@ mented primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats were observed in rats from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; rab@@ bits were not observed ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid is an agent of a substance that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the killing of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decl@@ ining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ rogen , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus once again gives the bone strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / used / used recently , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known that they are damaging the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta , along with food and beverages , you are worried that according to the instructions of your doctor , you can take enough fluid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a vein .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ asta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ asta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before completing the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta if you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with first inf@@ usion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you get A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry out the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia develops whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • the over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more I
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out to over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive drug for setting up smoking compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? er The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tissue . n@@ g The complete list of side effects reported associated with A@@ comp@@ lia is the package supplement . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , give rise to a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ des . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of using HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; he also in patients who - in addition to obesity - have no noticeable risks , can occur depres@@ sive reactions . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons ) may point out that it is necessary to monitor the re@@ occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently demonstrated .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the extra dose of plac@@ ebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin continued to decrease the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ der@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one - in blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the transportation of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available to use pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror increases up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver cells are to be controlled as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms which indicate a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , over@@ bau@@ ch@@ edness , ti@@ red@@ ness , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be conducted by the clinical assessment up to the pre @-@ examination of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven to be ag@@ itated by fat deposits and in some cases is associated with a liquid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ clusi@@ on by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral dou@@ ble@@ - or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported in the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ ds , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a incidence or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a dimin@@ ution of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the taking of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but regular physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients talk about disturb@@ ances of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or if this occurs , treatment is to be dropped ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies of interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker , and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity is reduced and the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , isolated cases : unknown ( not estimated of available data ) . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a transi@@ ent change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ fr@@ active index of the lens , as it is also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T recei@@ pts passed the three times the upper limit of the normal range as compared to plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
&quot; since the market launch rarely has been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.2 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) , which results in the animal model to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat , and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ cos@@ ine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study conducted with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value reduced by 0,@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ etics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was detected , while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness corresponds to the three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induction ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; following an oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and to a lower degree in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that in treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity is reduced and the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth is reduced . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment led with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ ds to an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ al tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated . &quot;
in clinical trials over 1 year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study l@@ acked the goal of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medicine , an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women was shown . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was tested in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ aph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane were out@@ weighing the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the acquisition of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dosage was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood glucose adjustment has significantly improved by an intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phases , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary for the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal insulin to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , going over several time zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor therefore has to consider possible interactions with the therapy and always consult his patients according to other medicines taken by them .
&quot; 4 If Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diab@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or cr@@ amps and end with temporary or permanent disturb@@ ances of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system occasional - Peri@@ ph@@ ere N@@ europ@@ athy An rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue occasional - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection site can arise a li@@ po@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the inser@@ tion points within the injection area .
&quot; general illnesses and dis@@ comfort at the site of the administration casual - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) . &quot;
&quot; disorders of the immune system occasional - Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rarely - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal ede@@ ma , breathing problems , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape picking , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary or given by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the entire duration of the operation is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule have been considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and for reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended - after the acet@@ aph@@ one has been removed from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not more than 25 ° C ) , before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ed according to the manual for the first use . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal insulin to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin . &quot;

this document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; an effective component of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; : &quot;

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients which may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ap@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union .
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be absorbed first , then the amount of insulin which is long acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , going over several time zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and dis@@ comfort at the end of the administration casual - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) . &quot;

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients who have under@@ gone major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id induced Nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mort@@ ality by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.7 % ) .
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
&quot; however , the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults . &quot;
inf@@ usion systems with acet@@ ap@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin human in inf@@ usion liquid 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de ; 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours using inf@@ usion bags made of poly@@ propylene .
&quot; 11 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , going over several time zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two or four weeks , the dose can be increased once a day 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , tox@@ ins can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients will be treated at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic or other medicines for the prevention of tox@@ ins . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared one year to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid levels in the blood were under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic received 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients receiving 120 mg once a day , with the last three measurements a ur@@ inary acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to that , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Study ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ inary acid level than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one of the current medical history known or current Gi@@ cht@@ no@@ des and / or a ven@@ erable arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um resin acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully studied ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ eic acid drugs , it may occur during the treatment start to an acute g@@ out attack because of the reduction in the ser@@ um acid level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can first be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) will increase the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies have been observed slight levels of hep@@ atic dys@@ functions in patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test prior to the beginning of the Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ a treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ been did not have any interaction studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll mirror ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ a ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
&quot; Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of dis@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids that contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operation of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ogram group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic illness and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could be related to the medicine and reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated simultaneously with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all February ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , r@@ ash concentration in the blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism and is created in the context of the Re@@ ac@@ es@@ as@@ k@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro in@@ hibition , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific ser@@ um resin acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment value at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for analysis . * p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of the ser@@ um resin acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in the doctor visit week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restri@@ c@@ ting the AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data of the open renewal study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um resin acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients required a treatment against a g@@ out rate ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the g@@ out node size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out node to the month of 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ s / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma @-@ centric @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma mass binding of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C marked Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as imm@@ utable Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ ( 3.5 μ ) / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ gs@@ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age No significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in bladder tum@@ ours ( transitional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , at about 11 times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered ir@@ relevant for clinical use .
&quot; it was noted that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats . &quot;
&quot; in case of high doses , which were approximately with 4.3 times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a decrease in the increase performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and with carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about the 13 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated simultaneously with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific ser@@ um resin acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the data of the open renewal study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um resin acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients required a treatment against a g@@ out rate ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) . &quot;

&quot; the owner of approval for the in@@ hibition has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , is ready before the drug is put into circulation , and so long is available how the drug is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline , an updated R@@ MP can be submitted to the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline . &quot;
&quot; additionally , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available which have an effect on the safety data , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to risk minim@@ isation • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk management ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can achieve concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and thus in this way a reduction of symptoms is achieved . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC should not be taken , • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or one of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor before taking this medicine before taking this medicine , or if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are suffering from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a row of cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder where too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a tox@@ in case at the moment ( sudden occurrence of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , warmth , and joint swelling ) , wait until the poison is de@@ pl@@ eted before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but also with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , occur if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , to prevent any arthritis or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are incub@@ ated ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data that originate from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data that indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose , which is needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , contrac@@ tion ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic elev@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other component AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in cases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transfer of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are exactly to follow to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day of the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract apart from p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , only given special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in the onset of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or post it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market launch ) gast@@ ric and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ omyel@@ itis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy is mainly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , which give indications whether using a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a jaw surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment of the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but will continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned at the intended day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before the onset of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tur@@ incidence in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the rank@@ ings of the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to pers@@ ist ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ rate by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first eating or drinking of the day . &quot;
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

&quot; after intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;

&quot; in the case of a dose of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects , the middle ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical trials have shown that the share of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data on it , it is nevertheless likely that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate such as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a slightly higher cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , which was compared with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been performed and examined how advoc@@ acy is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components , advoc@@ acy may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with advoc@@ acy , as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the simultaneously taken medication must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clinical relevance of the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the wor@@ ding or the regime should only be performed under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below ) .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talent levels should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection . oral advoc@@ acy therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
dosage recommendations - Li@@ ver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection . oral advoc@@ acy therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - change from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f a transplan@@ t receiver for twice daily dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , thus this conversion has to be carried out in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation commen@@ ces for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ t In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients Ob@@ aly there is no clinical experience with advoc@@ acy , pancre@@ atic and bow@@ el transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
&quot; patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including regular determination of the ser@@ um incre@@ ment levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ let and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in case of switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood flow in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the benefit of full @-@ blood tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels .
&quot; it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after adjustment of pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood can not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the talent level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in case of adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the wor@@ ding or the regime should only be performed under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during treatment with advoc@@ acy should be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is provided , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions by appropriate clothing or using a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f &apos;s hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , are special caution in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels at the simultaneous dose of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even more levels ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabol@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lowers the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormon@@ al exposure , decisions are particularly cau@@ tious when decisions regarding contrac@@ eption measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients showed no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposition , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side effects are performed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ soluble and high binding on ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
mechanisms of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to be medi@@ ated by the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cells and thus avo@@ ids the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ ots genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the T cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ ines ( such as Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f group ( N = 237 ) 32.@@ 6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 234 ) .
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9,@@ 2 % for Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) died . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mos@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recei@@ vers . &quot;

&quot; incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , bi@@ op@@ sy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 212 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 212 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference in treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ ag@@ raf@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.1 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.1 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of twice daily pro@@ gra@@ f capsules according to other primary organ transplan@@ tations Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; 175 l@@ ung@@ ed patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing a pancre@@ as transplan@@ t and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies reported the observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney , and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; in an interim analysis , a recently conducted , multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it was in 21.@@ 7 % of cases related to the formation of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8,0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5,@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patient of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ a- syn@@ dro@@ ms in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was significantly lower . &quot;
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients , which at the same time under@@ went a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t , which were obtained after a random@@ ized trial Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods of early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 antagon@@ ist dac@@ liz@@ umab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to Tal@@ mud radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ age value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism led by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via the bile duct . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients treated by pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ utter disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether adv@@ ata is used for the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A are suffering from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union named Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional trials in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , Adv@@ ata efficacy was awarded with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic periods . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ata ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ant may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the transport of Adv@@ ata throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma bar ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , a proper determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma gas is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of the inj@@ ections . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis The long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; dosage speed should be directed after the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is most important and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ esi@@ astic known inhibit@@ ors , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product was observed on another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s associated with the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of which have previously untreated patients , who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of each patient ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 expos@@ ures with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or was observed after exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
patients with previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms reported to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes was reported in several repeated product tex@@ tures as part of the study . &quot;

the activated factor VIII works as a C@@ of@@ actor for the activated factor IX and speeds up the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE have been performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( basic value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk assessment , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the applicant should apply another extension procedure for 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially distributed the Medic@@ inal Products Committee ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ drew its application for approval for the in@@ hibition of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that links other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) thereof . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is produced from the non @-@ defective part of the human body , is normally used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the abdominal area , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the answers of the company on the questions posed to him , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP on Day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not assume the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed substance release means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly , over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nose path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al membrane swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) , are fl@@ atten@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can rel@@ ieve on con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main factors were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when viewing all h@@ ay fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only swelling of the nas@@ al membrane was considered , patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who were involved in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@

&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole in whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing or ch@@ ew@@ ing it ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for harm@@ fulness and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after decrease of swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase inhibit@@ or ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of termination of such treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients need to be informed that the treatment must be removed in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or an increase of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the following patient groups is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise have positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether it was used alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ fulness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , do not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ ical properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce runs . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , fri@@ vol@@ ous mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , aspir@@ ation , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ als pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , am@@ ax@@ ia , visual dys@@ functions and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il firm@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P sel@@ ector on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight line , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined on the basis of the overall service for the symptom ( except nas@@ al membrane swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the weak@@ ening effect , determined by the nas@@ al membrane swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were poor@@ ly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine is bio @-@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety treatments , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive medicine , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ st@@ ox@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application described , Phar@@ mak@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets lin@@ dern symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing eyes with con@@ current con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
20 In certain circumstances you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous mu@@ c@@ ous drugs pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine that is contained in this medicine .

&quot; tell your doctor if you can perform or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • Blood pressure • Heart ch@@ ase , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache , or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you take aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken a short time , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
use in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or lowers the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze as you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , if you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not stated in this usage information .
&quot; ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ dro@@ ught , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , depression , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , head@@ ache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin it was very rare in cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for inser@@ ting ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 M@@ g@@ - and 5 mg enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 m@@ g. a day , which in the form of 2,5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; in total , A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies of seasonal hypo@@ critical r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) . &quot;
&quot; effectiveness has been measured by calcul@@ ating the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ gles , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way how the tablets and the application of children are harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom increased after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ x@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe a permit for the transportation of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the application of children from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be eff@@ ected according to the previous disease course and may be resum@@ ed after the onset of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their recur@@ rence .
in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adolescents from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , which was treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes the blocking of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P sel@@ ector on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses , administered in the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in which di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight line , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the overall results of the questionn@@ aire for the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of eti@@ ology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be easily rec@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; since the history of hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that , besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria lead to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines , was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ance significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where the patient demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
there are no indications of a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following daily use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) were not based on the availability of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and Re@@ production ox@@ ic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; color film ( includes l@@ act@@ ose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ess , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ess , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ ber doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious r@@ hin@@ itis with ag@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 are restricted to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and undergo a higher level of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup for children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to metabolic , is identical with the children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials have no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither to an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment , nor an increase in sleep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall results of the questionn@@ aire for the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decreased the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ ru@@ ff formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis that are restricted to metabolic rate .
&quot; after 3 to 6 hours , the load ( AU@@ C ) was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours . &quot;
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ accumulation after a daily use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III brown bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for injection with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to take once daily in the mouth to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate is taken to remove without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated . this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day more than 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight line , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg enam@@ el tablets once daily put into the mouth , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the application of children from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is taken without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not dimin@@ ish significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be a bio @-@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for the inser@@ tion formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day more than 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight line , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( adult 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet using A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for inclusion were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined by pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ study studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; at a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight line , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg enam@@ el tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for inclusion were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical signs of irrit@@ ation for the enam@@ el tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to metabolic , is identical with the children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported over which were reported more often than in plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dosage of 2.5 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can vary depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall results of the questionn@@ aire for the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution includes the same concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no bio @-@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it meets sy@@ rup and tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially shared the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ drew its application for approval for the in@@ hibition of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of cavi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus emerges , which can easily be spread from man to man , because people have not yet built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; following the ino@@ cul@@ ation of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; physically alien@@ ated &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system later is able to form more rapidly antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this tribe . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane man@@ ure of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a foreign body ) has been puri@@ fied , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who do not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ tig@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood is that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase used with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r has been compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults , who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load occurred in A@@ gener@@ ase after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ tig@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash , and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded as as@@ tig@@ ase and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are A@@ gener@@ ase take the risk of li@@ po@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( canc@@ ers of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines presented HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the in@@ stig@@ ation of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster@@ y of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ tig@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and patients with severe liver dysfunction can be reduced to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ tig@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially deadly course .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of these medicines .
patients with pre @-@ existing hep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ or@@ tik@@ oids , which are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the elevated risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some pharmaceuticals that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised ratio ) , there are methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of decreased plasma gas ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ aque symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl alcohol content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
as@@ tig@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported via diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy medications were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids are present . &quot;
&quot; HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , resulting in severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised above CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to compens@@ ate the reduced plas@@ m@@ gas levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ irable effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with Johannis@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already pic@@ ks Johannis@@ kr@@ aut , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the cur@@ rant . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; increased by 508 % , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and ritual avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which demonstrate the efficacy and harm@@ fulness of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % humili@@ ated when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended for close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and harm@@ fulness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that there are at least one hour apart due to the fan@@ ta@@ sies of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with pren@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine might decrease the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) from Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to a rise of side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ tig@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is advised to at least half of the recommended dose , though no clinical data is available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could be increased the plas@@ m@@ gas of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of two daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 15 ) once a day without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as as@@ tig@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va known as enzyme recep@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ tig@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % range 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous dose of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ or@@ tik@@ oids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabol@@ isation is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive enh@@ ancements of the plasma bars are expected in con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; because plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used along with oral @-@ recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while working with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plas@@ m@@ gas bar of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous em@@ ulation of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother as compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r goes over with people into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ung in uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding period . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproduction , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal . &quot;
the harm@@ fulness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early up and rarely led to the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are associated with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to treat HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ cal@@ ation and performed in more than 1 % of patients as well as under treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ wn @-@ fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ previously treated persons treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din , over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull jackets ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually disappeared during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ eously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be broken . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI previously treated patients , which received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , were similar to the incidence of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values that were received in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is observ@@ able on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral Gag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein@@ stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r chemotherapy regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically investigated . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred inside the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to assess the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased ph@@ an@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
clinical trials based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to evaluate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies who distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , however , is generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates . &quot;
early termination of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ isolation threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was used twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , therapy optimisation should be taken into consideration in using PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral dosing , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) is up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; increased by 508 % , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ tig@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg thri@@ ce daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is a 14 % less flexible solution than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma mirrors comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous treatment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of human exposure , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to the human being , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality both in the control animals and with the animals treated with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; during a systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for some pharmaceuticals that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentration . &quot;
as@@ tig@@ ase should be set to 27 when a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; increased by 508 % , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended for close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and harm@@ fulness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister a Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ tig@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dosage 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % range 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous em@@ ulation of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl alcohol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ung in uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ fulness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is observ@@ able on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , therapy optimisation should be taken into account with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ tig@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages that spoke to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of human exposure after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality both in the control animals and with the animals treated with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation routes are not fully mature in young , so Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion was not covered with PI previously treated patients with PI previously treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to take away ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since there is no dose recommendation for simultaneous use of as@@ tig@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ in content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion in inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated . &quot;
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ tig@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised ratio ) , there are methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
as@@ tig@@ ase should be set off for duration when a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ ids are present . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; increased by 508 % , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take up may not be applied during pregnancy based on possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col in pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r goes over with people into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ung in uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the harm@@ fulness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are associated with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to treat HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r chemotherapy regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on these data , therapy optimisation should be taken into consideration in using PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large ve@@ to volume and an un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; during a systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; your doctor will normally point out A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to rein@@ force the effect of as@@ tig@@ ase . &quot;
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor for you and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above diseases or taking any of the above drugs .
&quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sters ) , make sure you have read the use information to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r prior to the treatment . &quot;
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect of children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; possibly you need additional factor VIII to control the increase of blood . − In patients who receive an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur . &quot;

&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion was not covered with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors previously treated patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; for applying low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( commonly used to ampli@@ fy the effect &#91; Boo@@ ster@@ y &#93; of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules ) along with A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting , no dosage recommendations can be given . &quot;

&quot; the other components are Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ ye@@ th@@ ylene gly@@ col 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate de@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied five times a week for six weeks , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; the cream is dil@@ uted before bed@@ time to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated six weeks or five times weekly . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • The complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;

&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can continue for so long until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or per@@ enni@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammation occurs ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examinations 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose is left , the patient sol@@ ves the cream once he / she notices this and then continue with the usual plan of therapy . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and cleaned in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is fully dra@@ ined . &quot;
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host response .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily famili@@ arity was carried out , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with one for circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ k@@ tur was observed . &quot;
&quot; in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations were also observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; until now , the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous treatment methods for the treatment of external F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital and peri@@ operative area has no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of asc@@ end@@ ant reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since no data is available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapies should be taken into consideration in super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended for previously untreated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the sub @-@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this purpose . therefore such application is not recommended .
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after removing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause serious dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after unique top@@ ical application of quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding period . &quot;
the most commonly shared and possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the site of treatment of asc@@ end@@ ants ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ al patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
&quot; side effects caused by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , clinical evidence suggest@@ ing that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation@@ ation / fl@@ yers / scales ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan the clinical signs showed that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often leads to severe ery@@ them@@ atic issues ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe scho@@ oling and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ op@@ last@@ y Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the atten@@ de@@ es during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients treated F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , which was 20 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) . &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for five @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ cili@@ ary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of application in one or two treatment times of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ ot@@ eric , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment are@@ als on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clin@@ ically healing after one or two treatment times .
&quot; the permitted indications of external F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , Ak@@ tin@@ an Ker@@ ato@@ sis and Super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in the patient &apos;s patients and were therefore not studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours , bet@@ ru@@ by 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ nasty bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study conducted for four months showed no similar effects on the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during the oral administration of three days per week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the point of use .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for the human being is considered very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this usage information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● surface bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a commonly found , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if untreated , it may result in con@@ stell@@ ations , especially in the face - therefore an early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to a lot of sunlight during their previous life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in shallow ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the super@@ ficial Bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or the virus responsible for infection with F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor about before you commen@@ ce with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until you cure any problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al membrane . &quot;
&quot; in case of acci@@ dental contact , remove the cream by rin@@ se with water . o Do not waste the cream in@@ war@@ dly . o Do not apply more cream than your doctor to you . o Falls reactions to the treated place that will give you strong in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the reactions are fl@@ aired , you can continue the treatment . do not inform your doctor if they do not have a normal blood pattern . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , the skin or difficulty of the fores@@ kin can be calculated with increased occurrence of con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival swelling , fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers of the skin or difficulty . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; taking other medicines to have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse during the infection with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is to perform after intercourse ( not previously ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od passes into breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of asc@@ end@@ ant , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; wear a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream on the clean , dry skin with the asc@@ ents and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully dra@@ ined . &quot;
men with asc@@ end@@ ant under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks each 5 days a week , a sufficient amount of al@@ dar@@ a cream apply to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects ( expecting more than 1 out of 10 patients ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( with less than 1 of 100 patients to expect ) occasional side effects ( with less than 1 of 1,000 patients to expect ) Very rare side effects ( expected to be less than 1 of 10,000 patients ) &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue using the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause that a blue stain is created faster or it can cause de@@ preci@@ ation .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice side effects that are not stated in this usage information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , these are easier skin reactions that can end up again within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , swelling , skin @-@ destruction , bladder , der@@ m@@ atitis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ plen@@ ishing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was evaluated mainly by the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its impact on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , pain sensation , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion point . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may react to patients who may be severely hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not to be applied . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary , update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is given to patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms , in terms of reactions to inf@@ usion and development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with proven diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side @-@ effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which rehabilitation centres for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase III trial , it is expected that almost all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against larv@@ ae , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the onset of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the event of light or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase above the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during Phase 3 study and pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years are listed in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breathing still@@ stand and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s undes@@ ired drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with a predominantly heavy run @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the onset of the treatment , with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version in patients aged under 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early departure from the study ) there were no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients with whom it was never too Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with a defect to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the basis for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and preventing further accumulation of adequate restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and is absorbed by cells into the lymp@@ h atoms , most likely above Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared to the plac@@ ebo group showed an improvement in the lung function and the ability to work in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease of the patient , which has been taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes are summ@@ arized across five atten@@ tiveness variables ( as expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minutes walking test , range of motion of the shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigating the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe course form and 4 with the middle course shape ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased Gag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group . the younger patients with the middle course form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe decay form , limited or even no progress in cognitive development were to be determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , research on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to the patients affected by older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ as@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time dose , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; since no toler@@ ability studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the ones listed below . &quot;

&quot; this tab will provide a long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural pro@@ g@@ nosis of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from M@@ PS I are an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken a short time , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentr@@ ator for the production of an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is provided for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for physicians and medical staff ) .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient carries this , will gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditioned participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breathing still@@ stand and facial oils . &quot;

&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution was under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me inf@@ usion ( by means of as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Follow the number of di@@ lu@@ te pier@@ cing bottles first after the body weight of the individual patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ a and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is additionally an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose is decreased . &quot;
&quot; the active form of ps@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed causes the formation of DNA and RNA , preventing the cells to divide . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ eri@@ zed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.2 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with the comparative drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to authori@@ ze the transfer of A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union . &quot;
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the cookie cutter and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is combined with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after conclusion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cancer , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given in the day before and in the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the therapy duration as well as for further 21 days after the last dose of the dose . &quot;
patients also need an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first dose of the dose and after each third session cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood flow or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 Blood .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be ab@@ orted when in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ tive teeth a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over 65 years there was an increased side @-@ effect risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 m@@ L / min no dose adjustments needed to go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin boundary value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not examined specifically in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ches and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ination has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality rates , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was observed when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed patients must be instruc@@ ted to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in whom these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ul@@ ary space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment is to be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; 5 heavy cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability is caused by tel@@ emet@@ ric acid , men should be advised in front of the treat@@ ment@@ - chin to obtain advice regarding the retention of the sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) lead to a reduced P@@ emet@@ ric separation with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction of 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy , unless necessary and after careful weighing of the use for the mother and the risk for fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability is caused by tel@@ emet@@ ric acid , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment , consult with regard to the sperm @-@ servi@@ ent system . &quot;
it is not known whether tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed into breast milk passes and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby can not be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , and the random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; common side effects : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data from spontaneous reports ) . &quot;
* * * * Move to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) should be reported by the term &quot; kid@@ neys / genital tract others . &quot; * * * Move to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) should only be reported as Grade 1 or 2 .
&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was established regarding the inclusion of all events in which the report@@ able doctor held a connection with ps@@ emet@@ re@@ xed and cis@@ pl@@ atin for possible . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients , who received random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and tel@@ emet@@ eri@@ zed , covered ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 265 patients , which were random@@ ized to receive dose of dose and vitamin B@@ 12 , as well as 276 patients random@@ ized with doc@@ et@@ axel as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
* * Move to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC Version 2 for each toxic@@ ity level . * * Move to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) should only be reported as Grade 1 or 2 .
&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was established regarding the inclusion of all events in which the report@@ able doctor held a connection with ps@@ emet@@ re@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients , who received random@@ ized P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the summ@@ arized results of three individual P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ Mon@@ other@@ api@@ aries , excluding neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
&quot; these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects , which could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive cis@@ pl@@ atin and ps@@ ori@@ asis and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ized to c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was established for the recording of all events in which the report@@ able physician had established a connection with ps@@ emet@@ re@@ xed and cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity which were reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( frequent ) of patients who were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed covered :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity which were reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ises cis@@ pl@@ atin and ps@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treated :
&quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ins@@ ult and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been reported in dental studies with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid , which is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were reported in patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
in clinical trials patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment sometimes reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in tel@@ emet@@ ric mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated during or after their tel@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.4 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ ly @-@ dependent met@@ aboli@@ cal processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ e syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ amide ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin with a mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin patients had clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only dis@@ cour@@ aged with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was undertaken in the population of all patients receiving investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in comparison with the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement in lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a displacement of the lung function over time in the controller .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA versus Doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 283 ) and from 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival was in favour of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a mainly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data of a separate random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who have allergy and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who took all@@ i 60 mg , after a year recorded an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ ial , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , o@@ ily ( win@@ ch ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft sto@@ ols . &quot;
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the inclusion of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fat reduction diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ised , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Sensi@@ tivity to active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tan@@ eous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tan@@ eous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic monitoring , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic medication must be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional contrac@@ eption measures , in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; following the dose of an A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one dosage , a limited number of volunteers received at the same time were observed , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain@@ ties . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in most of the cases reported after the market launch , there were either side effects or similar side effects reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a fast rep@@ lication of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ ti@@ ant properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ in rest of the ga@@ stro and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , three times a day , absorbed the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ al . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , o@@ ily @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies , weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months . &quot;
mean change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.6 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; in the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general with therapeutic dos@@ ages not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which administered the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plastic surgery . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be recognized as a special danger to humans . &quot;

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used in obes@@ e adults aged 18 and above with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight or over@@ weight in relation to your height .
&quot; even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for a check @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; for each weight of 2 kg , which you lose within the frame of a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken a short time , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , in severe rheumato@@ id arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood th@@ inning effect . &quot;
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive contrac@@ ep@@ tive and all@@ i • The effect of oral and increasing means of pregnancy prevention ( pill ) may be weak@@ ened or revers@@ ed when you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
&quot; before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for treating heart rhythm disorders . &quot;
&quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and if you take drugs against high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; how to define your cal@@ ory and fat limits , see Fur@@ ther helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you have a meal or a meal no fat contains , do not take capsules . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to get used to your body in the new eating habits , begin before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; food di@@ aries are effective as you can compreh@@ end what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Take fat powder to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before starting with taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity .
&quot; • all@@ i may not be taken longer than 6 months . • If you can &apos;t notice any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of application of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , you must stop taking all@@ i . • With a successful weight loss , it is not about setting up the diet only at short notice and then return to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take capsules . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules , resulting in increasing fat from the body . &quot;
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the treatment starts because at this time you might not have consistently reduced fat percentage in diet .
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional benefits : • Beg@@ inning a few days , or better a week before taking capsules with a fat reduction diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat quantity evenly on the daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a high @-@ fat main court or a durable table , as you may possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• Ke@@ ep medicine for children in@@ accessible . • You may not use all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cart@@ on . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ elles that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low it in any case . • You can carry out your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transportation box ( Shuttle ) which is included in this pack .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • Heart disease • stroke treatment • oste@@ o@@ arthritis - talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to eat health@@ ily health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as speci@@ fying on the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what amount is suitable for you , take a look at the information below , which indicates the number of calories you are suitable for . • Because of the capsule functioning , the observ@@ ance of the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight capture while reducing the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This decreased cal@@ orie intake should enable you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to put realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Tr@@ y is a nutrition diary with information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight capture combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of further information materials that can help you feed on cal@@ orie and fat metabolism and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type of weight loss , this information helps you to develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as with chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic medicine ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there are not enough information on the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the in@@ stig@@ ation of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ powered chemotherapy , due to cancer illness and the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ powered chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ powered chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thickness of the col@@ on , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- interval is prolonged or which tend to such extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy treatment , Alo@@ xi is not to be used either for preventing or treating nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five studied chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar pre@@ valence of adverse events like in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships to observe .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis trials performed , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably is not an effective treatment for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received , which was given to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ated chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion@@ als involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range from 0,@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean mean dose of 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients ran@@ ged from day 1 to day 5 mean dose of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the equivalent of 0.75 mg of measured value ; however the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the uniqu@@ eness of 0.75 mg .
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less dimensions , the is@@ so@@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous injection injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 m@@ L / min and ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , but a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From pre@@ clinical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the action potential . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ am@@ ples of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which have been given daily for two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al bone ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and because Alo@@ xi is determined for unique application , the relevance of these results is very low to humans . &quot;
the owner of this permit is to inform the European Commission on the plans for the in@@ stig@@ ation of the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which Al@@ ph@@ eon approved 6 million IE / ml injection solution prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ nei@@ cally effective constitu@@ ent that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference doctors &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( prolonged ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage occurs , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon sets up data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference doctor . &quot;
&quot; in the study , it was measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 out of 48 weeks and 6 months after the treatment was treated ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; following the adjustment of the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease re@@ tar@@ ded again in more patients than with the reference doctor . in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study investig@@ ates the question to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cracks or chi@@ ves ) , scrap@@ ers and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Al@@ ar@@ go might not affect these kinds of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface to be treated . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ ung to the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.7 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin @-@ dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the order site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go prev@@ ailed against the risks during the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little Laz@@ er@@ ations , scrap@@ ers or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined once and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , treatment should be ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as path@@ ogens ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary wound wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ in@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be taken into account if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached in humans after top@@ ical use on isolated skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After con@@ current oral dose of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the sk@@ ew@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary when top@@ ical retin@@ opathy is applied during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement of effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; in deciding whether to continue / stop breast@@ feeding , or to continue the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go has applied , the most common reported side effect Ir@@ rit@@ ation was at the site of the site that concerned about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50@@ S unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partially block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms seem question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily including oc@@ clusi@@ on to intact skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the retin@@ os@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ opathy in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with low involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro verification on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats evidence of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching a maximum of 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ew@@ ed skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development ox@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were established . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the in@@ let must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the 1.@@ 8.1 module of the application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the license agreement is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for the human use , the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; if irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms of the treated place show , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not explicitly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment comes from hiding on one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gaz@@ ette , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged one to 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation and ensuring that the vacc@@ ination plan can end up from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix can be given or another hepatitis A or B vaccine . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines affect the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and since 1997 approved vaccine , Twin@@ rix children . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given a vacc@@ ination plan in three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrations .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix caused a month after the last injection to develop anti @-@ antibody concentrations of hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , red@@ ness , mat@@ ri@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the in@@ stig@@ ation of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the standardis@@ ation plan for Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a vaccine is requested for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis A antibody levels are the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed a hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need to be vacc@@ inated as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even when antibodies are not det@@ ectable . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the application of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disturb@@ ances of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels , so that in these cases the dose of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact failure , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected to sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections , since it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular medicine to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection , simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ism , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us out@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , m@@ ess , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ age and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity on a calculation basis per vaccine dose , but not based on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ernity was comparable per specimen ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity was low and comparable to those observed after the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that which was observed when administration with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix he was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was statisti@@ cally not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines aged 1 to 15 years , the servo conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the servo conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 received two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with the 289 people , whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 year @-@ old one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with a combined hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vaccine .
the immun@@ o@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to that which was diagnosed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose @-@ volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12 - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies comparable is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year was administered simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ism , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us out@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and servo conversion rates as for the former formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC amended , state batch sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory for that purpose . &quot;

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in water contaminated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms which may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines ( though you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has already occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually envis@@ aged administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per ino@@ cul@@ ation dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination against the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child receive further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without a prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or has been given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) / has or this is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) has already shown to you / your child .
&quot; if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the inc@@ ision or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ure • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • Appeti@@ zing
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness • g@@ astro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; other side effects , which have been reported very rarely days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include local limited or extended sur@@ charges that can be it@@ ching or can be ves@@ ical , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like dis@@ comfort , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , illnesses of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement capacity of some body parts , strong head@@ aches and rigi@@ dity of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you may notice side effects that are not specified in this package supplement .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for the market launch , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since ambition was placed in traffic only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ aps - split by several individual cans to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because ammon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , loss of loss , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ aps in patients with mal@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle are effectively prevented .
&quot; ammon@@ aps have been approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information is available to this medicine . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme defect is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ ical form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) there is an indication of the use , if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy is present in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
ar@@ gin@@ ine deficiency in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is done via the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ ate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturb@@ ances in the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate recorded for each gram can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is provided early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ age was almost always inf@@ anti@@ le , and the disease even led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analogue within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ ical form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ hic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ Tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atically with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous dosage of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral sol@@ der dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ c@@ lic acid or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma in the following morning . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma bar were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is secre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine above the kid@@ neys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules will either be taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , which can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain @-@ bark .
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ ate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess oxygen . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate recorded for each gram can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ules form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins . &quot;
&quot; if your laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are using AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken a short time , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding period , you should not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine could go over into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , rel@@ o@@ ading of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disturb@@ ance and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency treatment of your hospital for initi@@ ating a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; if you are using AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken a short time , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS evenly over the same single doses or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ r ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another antibody ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent sh@@ utter ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a dose of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who undergo a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as for people with severe blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the transportation of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in a further row , an additional Bol@@ us should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; following the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure a stu@@ b can be administered from 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous stu@@ b of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a common bol@@ us dose of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to below 225 seconds , a second bolt output of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT amount is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ o against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is 225 seconds , a second stu@@ b dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose must be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension or elevated blood pressure due to a mal@@ function of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine is administered in combination with another antibody ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if most of the bleeding of arter@@ ial points occur in the case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during treatment in principle bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taken war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after removal of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din has been achieved before treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the drug mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase blood pressure . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or antibodies , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly checked in each case . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , or hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without apparent bleeding point , re@@ constructive surgery due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations occ@@ uring at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine is immediately removed and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the anim@@ ator region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or to the cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine slowly spl@@ its the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was unable to indu@@ ce thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows an anti @-@ dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional Bol@@ us should be given by 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients undergoing angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with AC@@ S .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or as continuous inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was diagnosed in insulin c@@ lis@@ ses compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % for human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ ins or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood glucose level .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the stomach @-@ cke . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active starch , the brand name ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or termination of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage .
&quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the insulin used , and can therefore change in changing the treatment scheme . &quot;
&quot; the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tic such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine can be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c bac@@ kl@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive medicine showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin ul@@ cer@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but insulin does not occur in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use . &quot;
&quot; the following are commonly known from clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organ@@ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration dysfunction , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , lack of loss , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d failed to change the injection site within the injection area continuously , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy on the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropriately trained person or by intraven@@ ous dose of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after glu@@ cos@@ al injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of urine for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( in particular through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin ul@@ is@@ ers the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in case of a normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin ul@@ is@@ in showed a propor@@ tion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that in an application of insulin ul@@ is@@ ers 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin ul@@ is@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was obtained , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control is applied as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin ul@@ is@@ in at dose 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , the 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin ul@@ is@@ in at dose 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
