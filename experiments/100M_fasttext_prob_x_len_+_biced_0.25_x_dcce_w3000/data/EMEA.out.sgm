<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for preventing manic episodes in patients that have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used for inserting or the enamel tablets in patients who are preparing the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are also degraded as Abilitify, should be adapted to the dose of Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their reoccurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent reoccurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours versus placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, altering the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body resorbits the melting tablets and the solution for inserting.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilitify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms of increased restlessness compared to patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder reduced Abilify in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks as placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled traction), tremor (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilitify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate manic episodes in bipolar-I-disturbance, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mostly in manic episodes, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the import of Abilitify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialdose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and has been reported in some cases after the onset or change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when symptoms and symptoms of a spätdyskinesia occur in a patient treated with abilify, consider reducing the dose or cancelling the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to an Mn or has unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of Mns, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures, with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, respectively, and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol around 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the shared gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be raised to the dosage level before starting the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethmorphine / 3-methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethmorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproduction studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients who were treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of eps was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases of CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3,5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or intentionally acute overdosages with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprzol; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing because Aripiprazol has a high plasma mass."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-disturbance via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine dopamine and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT7- to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7- to alpha-1-adrenergic and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">"with a dose of Aripiprazol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11c-racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and the Putamen."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 of the respondents who contributed to the study media were similar (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%) in both groups."</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disturbance Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disturbance Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a preservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also pointed out a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy with therapeutic response, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valprostrate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, who had reached a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilizing phase before Randomisation, Aripiprazol compared with regard to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a decline in the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyylation of Aripiprazol, the N-dealkyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolisers via CYP2D6 and at almost 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic examination schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprzol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different radial cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductiontoxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicological significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions, which have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects covered a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3- to 10times of middle steady state exposure (AUC) at recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"flu pandemic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus emerges, which can easily be spread from man to man, because people have not yet built immunity (no protection)."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"following the inoculation of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus as" "physically alienated" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"in this way, the immune system later is able to form more rapidly antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this tribe."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the membrane manure of the virus with the" surface antigens "(proteins on membrane surface, which detects the human body as a foreign body) has been purified, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="1900">Survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1905">"for patients who do not swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for inclusion, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"astigase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood is that the virus is addressed to the medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1907">"the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight."</seg>

<seg id="1910">"not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who previously had not been treated with protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"the drug Agenerase used with low-dosed Ritonavir has been compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults, who used protease inhibitors earlier."</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"in the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir."</seg>
<seg id="1915">"in children Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to treatment."</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines presented HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not take protease inhibitors is not proven."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"Agenerase was originally approved under" "exceptional circumstances", "since only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the instigation of Agenerase in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"usually, Agenerase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic boostery of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Section4.2 and 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to take up is 14% less than ampprenavir as capsule; therefore Agenerase capsules and solution for inserting on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (Boostery), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">"pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of astigase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and patients with severe liver dysfunction can be reduced to 300 mg twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"the simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3)."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that astigase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase prevents the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>

<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapine might decrease the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">"if these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasmgas."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"when these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) from Rifabutin by 193% and thus to a rise of side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with astigase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin is advised to at least half of the recommended dose, though no clinical data is available."</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed but could be increased the plasmgas of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of two daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of Ritonavir at 200 mg ketoconazol once a day led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-15) once a day without the simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can, if applied together with Agenerase, may lead to interactions."</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">"based on the data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida can not be taken at the same time as astigase, since it can come to resorption disorders."</seg>
<seg id="1984">"the simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva known as enzyme receptors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Amprenavir."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine and verapamil may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"simultaneous intake with astigase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensify with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"in a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% range 82 to 89%)."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"as a result, the simultaneous dose of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucoortikoids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1989">"with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolisation is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, distinctive enhancements of the plasma bars are expected in concurrent administration of Agenerase."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"because plasma-level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with amprenavir."</seg>
<seg id="1991">"it is recommended to be more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of Amprenavir (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Agenerase may not be used along with oral-recorded Midazolam (see section 4.3) while working with parenteral Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasmgas bar of Midazolam to 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"if methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as the Amprenavir- dose is to be adjusted when amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"with simultaneous emulation of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"the effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception are recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in concurrent administration of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2883">"during the PCI, patients often have a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent shutter), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin."</seg>
<seg id="2884">"in the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a dose of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"in patients who undergo a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin."</seg>
<seg id="2886">"angiox may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivaliruine, other Hirudine, or any of the other components."</seg>
<seg id="2887">"it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as for people with severe blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection."</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"if a PCI is performed in a further row, an additional Bolus should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and the infusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"following the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"immediately before the procedure a stub can be administered from 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous stub of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a common bolus dose of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"if this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to below 225 seconds, a second bolt output of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolus dose is quickly administered intravenously."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"as soon as the ACT amount is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivaliro against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"if the ACT-value is 225 seconds, a second stub dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdose must be checked again."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"in patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivaliruine-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-ulisin is very slightly different from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot be effectively processed, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was diagnosed in insulin clisses compared to a decrease of 0.14%."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% for human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisins or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the stomach-cke."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the active starch, the brand name (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin needs."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or termination of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"the time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the drug profile of the insulin used, and can therefore change in changing the treatment scheme."</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dioxetine, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphine, propoxyphs, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by an appropriately trained person or by intravenous dose of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after glucosal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of urine for severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (in particular through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin ulisers the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in case of a normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study with 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin ulisin showed a proportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-ulisin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that in an application of insulin ulisers 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-prandial triglycemic control is reached like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
