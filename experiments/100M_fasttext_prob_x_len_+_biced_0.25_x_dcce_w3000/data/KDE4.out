&quot; to translate the module website , you will find in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - menu under Extras website . select the output and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if part of the text is selected , only this part is translated into place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore the translations should not make important decisions without checking the translation before .
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can paste texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; includes different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making it easier to use . &quot;
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings extensions ... Open the box tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Canc@@ el . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes if present . &quot;
the Reg@@ ular filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M @-@ tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to graphi@@ cally present ne@@ sted folders with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . accordingly , large files can be detected even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the tre@@ ad representation a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have useful colour and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either display depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordin@@ ate right angles is to be used ( whereby , consequently , rendering errors may occur due to restrictions in the character of the tre@@ ble ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of performance algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the surface of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is useful for the labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses through frames that rec@@ tan@@ gles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive divisions . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal area for an entry via the menu item view . instead , a room pattern is drawn into the area of the higher order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind application .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens which allows you to set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a turning field to adjust the number of mini pictures of each line in the gallery .
&quot; to view the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , see whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , you specify whether the file size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box image size , please indicate whether the size of the pictures is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the File Selection File menu , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can adjust with a slider or a turning field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
copy the original images to the gallery with the check box .
using the check box comment file you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras / HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; view menu under the navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in media playback . &quot;
&quot; to change browser detection , add a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add the browser and operating system ID for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; changes in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to use the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry , you can set the scope of the information on the used browser and the operating system in the individual . &quot;
with this &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ module check your &amp; CSS ; style templates and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .
check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the menu under Extras website . you can make the following ex@@ ams :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; check if your &amp; HTML ; match the syntax of &amp; HTML ; matches , all found errors are displayed . with this check , you can make sure that your pages are displayed by all browsers correctly . &quot;
&quot; allows you to check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets included in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; document included . with valid &amp; CSS , your web pages have a uniform appearance independent of the browser used . &quot;
check the links on your page for further instructions and faul@@ ty links .
here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; style sheets .
with the module web archiving for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can save websites with text and images in .@@ was format .
&quot; click on &quot; &quot; Archive &quot; &quot; with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed website . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . of course , every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management - workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users .
&quot; this opens a dialogue with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to answer you questions about other users from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for noti@@ fying in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name , or click the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folders . no image will be changed . while searching the folder , you will see a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ys recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you can not exclude sub @-@ folders , unless there is i@@ ste in hidden folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo taken from the album and this will be used as an album symbol . more details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Support menu . &quot;
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . of course , every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as disk drive . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ photo@@ 2 program to communicate with Digital@@ kam@@ er@@ as@@ . g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras . it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ k@@ am can be read reliably . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy it can expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ vi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; moving and storing images functions everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , via the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name works only if this ind of the symbol view is also displayed . which fields are displayed , you can configure the dialog of the settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single night@@ stand . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you will have to choose whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed by a common name . the collection from you will be used to sorting your photos . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ dest , average , ne@@ sts : these set the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; it should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select a different picture as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Select &quot; &quot; in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; an album can only be contained in a collection , and collections cannot be obsc@@ ured . &quot;
&quot; the collection includes all photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you must wait short while thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided in which you can recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . which information is , you can change over settings digi@@ kam . change the albums Page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such a help window .
&quot; photos are all about &amp; digi@@ kam ; works . albums and keywords allow you to organize your photos as it suits you . you can see all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can view all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can choose between the view of the images , a slideshow or the editing of the images . &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select . in section digi@@ kam ; image editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button , and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not save these data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to click the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can click the right mouse button to preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer von &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use it by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ Parking ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags include a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . keywords are stick@@ ers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all the photos marked with this key@@ word are displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also work together parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; &quot; quot ; &quot; &quot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word , or click on an existing key@@ word . if you click on an existing key@@ word , click on an existing key@@ word after clicking on an existing key@@ word , this will be the key@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select del@@ e@@ tion . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears , giving you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking with the right mouse button and edit the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a key@@ word , you can click on the relevant key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; . &quot; alternatively , you can also use the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails of the pictures and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can specify a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to him assigned keywords . in this way , you can assign a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear in the main window in the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the keywords menu Rem@@ ove . the menu displays only the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the Tim@@ eline View displays a time @-@ dependent setting of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time@@ frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit . by this , all the related pictures are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; the search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search results . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all pictures are shown again . if Search is not found , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which is always filtering what you entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select Edit , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information entered . if you select as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for searching . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select search in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Exten@@ ded search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ous ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . all rules are line @-@ wise , separated by operators . each option can be added to this list with search group / search group . any option can be associated with others about logical operations . all ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they conform . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar . by using a Schw@@ ell@@ ert , the results selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you want to push a picture from somewhere on the icon of the unt@@ apped search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand paint sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; find the right images . also here a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can push it in or move out with the mouse wheel . push C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em light@@ table from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; from the preview window , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a series of pictures . if you use combination wise , the two first images will automatically be loaded into the area to compare it . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions work directly from the light@@ table as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it simple to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in turn function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to bend the visible area of the picture , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will display the same image area . &quot;
the zoom works just like in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers each part of the process following after the picture has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos takes , scann@@ ed or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we will provide you with a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , protect , protect and use photos again . we will consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , re@@ group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , servic@@ ing , servic@@ ing , servic@@ ing , servic@@ ing , and export@@ ing image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you do not need to use a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can access the metadata both in a database and in the image files . &quot;
&quot; your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if other access to your photos should be organized , whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same location . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different subjects and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option to store in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently select the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do that , &amp; digi@@ kam , provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now assign each photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos for further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ words , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically build the tree for you , res@@ ize the images in the right place . the modification of the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree on another . the changed keywords are monitored by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the graphics show how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since every block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to see your photos just , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , association , have memories , the historic period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you are moving . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; you can set it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your pictures in web galleries , then these inscri@@ ptions are exported to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or title of the web gallery system . &quot;
&quot; remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already using light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographic information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : associated with the author . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed equally . &quot;
&quot; this must not be the author . if the photographer is a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here to provide the picture to others . if the photograph is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate error , plate failure , power violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , desktop prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that can happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled cau@@ tious and you can &apos;t take longer than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that appears to be wonders for CDs and DVDs , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before downloading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; in short , Dis@@ ks hold the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot detect this error . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also save data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not make a lot of electricity , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes are different . these can cause serious damage . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy levels and gro@@ oves the rest . however , it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in connector . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since a surge voltage can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripher@@ als connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage sho@@ cks which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to work even further until electricity is running . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always think of all cables before going on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and B@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it is quite distur@@ bing that there should be no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have thought of it . nobody seems to have thought of it . nobody seems to have thought of it . nobody seems to have thought of it . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures at low levels and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ f fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms using the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spotted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more wor@@ sen@@ ing . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high quality look are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . therefore , backup your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous or re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft trage@@ dies : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ aster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above is a common cause for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ating : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily setup on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that have really been changed . this happens when you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further th@@ inning should be done manually after you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , stored in the image file IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at everything today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ s ; # functions with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it can save a lot more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with low @-@ loss compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages pictures in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open format format designed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &quot; &quot; image resource block &quot; &quot; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your photo , most of the time in rough format , archi@@ ved . X@@ MP adap@@ ts because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization committed to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera body are , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it to your Roh@@ archiv . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a sophisticated editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ous , then you should add the metadata again . these were under certain circumstances cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them in web galleries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the addition of a photo to an album , you will find a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and switch it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras show no preview images . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are shown on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image is not yet downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available on some digital cameras .
&quot; the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata as required , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS , etc . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image processing . note that these metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download all the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , you can download the download button and select Sel@@ ected . the selected button can be downloaded until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the button All you want to download or download selected , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . you can read the list of existing albums , as usual folder . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ happened ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you want to delete only some , you must first select it and then delete the selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should check carefully whether the photos have been successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ ous ; you should carefully check if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually recycled , after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can be useful , the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options to rotate and mirror image and for database @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you want a different date format than standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . for further modifications , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or Up@@ per@@ cases , if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used if you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the point of view to perform an automatic turn during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the side@@ bar metadata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , lets &amp; digi@@ pack ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced turn and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , it may be possible to create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a @-@ Data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in that case saves &amp; digi@@ happened ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced tab and select the date @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ happened ; you , where the images are to be uploaded , select the folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position indicated in length and width is indicated and which can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ FE or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to mapping an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users want to locate the location of the photo so that you want to locate the location of the photo , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first , you should know that Ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and card references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and last about manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographi@@ cally mapping module . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the length and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them , by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; select action can be displayed on one @-@ hand preview or image editing should be started , so you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note , if you click on an entry in the main screen . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . even in database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; car title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify who the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if this is included for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC rim . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam . these metadata also are available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported without losing .
&quot; save image cap@@ tions as embedded inscri@@ ptions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the inscri@@ ptions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window above a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ happened ; view , you can add and remove file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; alb@@ um@@ folder that will not have any of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or bright colour in the picture . these colors are defined here . in the image processing this visual mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ous density than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TIFF compressed , you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it does not affect the image quality , because the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy mode , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the image slightly soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a solid color balance , which is photograp@@ hed on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned to look at the lights , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top lights . finally , use the setting of continuous white in the settings . finally , you can attempt to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to recon@@ struct the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the particles that have many cameras and which makes a matrix color @-@ coloured pixel available . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color change correction since you are performed during the conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives directions how it should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam . information such as the color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
&quot; if a picture is opened in the image processing , start a color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; create the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , in which you save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of the ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print a picture because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon profile expansion makes it possible to realize the style for the finish : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the picture transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left side . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option Con@@ fir@@ mation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly implemented through &amp; digi@@ ous ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam , when starting . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the starting process of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ous ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ happened ; you , if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; use to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry Listings / Edit . &quot;
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the image processing section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , enlar@@ ging factor , and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before you have saved file storage or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo anymore once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File Save as you do . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing or using the button The button Rest@@ ore of Image Processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since last saved . &quot;
almost every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing undo / restore by editing re @-@ creating from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down , or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can zoom in and zoom in the picture in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ ty menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam . you can call it from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window . see the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . all image templates can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the Album Export printer Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is , without the navigation arrows , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the descriptions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next picture , the inscri@@ ptions are then stored . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . &quot;
&quot; the Evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the key@@ word used previously at this &amp; digi@@ ous . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of ways in search of a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is applied only to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , key@@ word and search views . if in addition one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords in the main screen . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to No keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree is drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialogue asks whether this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can choose an Advanced search over all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that have actually photograp@@ hed or scann@@ ed colors come from your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ controlled workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color administration . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; if so , if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another color space and then have to think about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e shaped region , and colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then click information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor , because s@@ RGB is selected . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve one image in most cases . therefore use it before you attempt a further manual processing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , balance , Automatic Ab@@ use and Con@@ tr@@ ast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction try automatically out of your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values over the entire picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing his shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; this method calcul@@ ates the brightness of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity canal is as flat as possible . this makes the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete Hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast enhancement : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the wid@@ est possible range and a re@@ ji@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because you are working on a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry Color White Balance of the Image Processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the destination image can be seen . the preview will dynam@@ ically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; the hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or download the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons stored as and loading make exactly this . every setting of the white balance that you have set , you can save it in a text file and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the pres@@ et button pres@@ ets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings can result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as those used for processing crude images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness settings . a detailed manual for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted from chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under colors of ton@@ ality correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , allowing you to use several color channels at the same time . this is useful if your camera or scanner will always need the same error and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter . &quot;
&quot; the coloured , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Eff@@ ect . it differs from satur@@ ation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a revers@@ ed color film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common to change the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color levels of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview .
&quot; if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is located ton@@ ing correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you will need only the area of the slider for the application purpose . more concrete the three slider below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controls , and pay attention to how the image changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis is displayed . in pictures the large areas of a constant color involve the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ points can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a light image as background while something else is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted to all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically based on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that have been captured using a digital camera , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short part to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding pixel dark@@ er are dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can make exactly this . any curve that you have created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photograph that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shade of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the destination image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you are using the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also want to reduce the respective color components . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color to a visible ro@@ ar that comes from the color @-@ space . color @-@ row consists of small room art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the color@@ box first . &quot;
save as well as store buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer settings can save you later and load it . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ancy is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image is shown below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating about your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step step , as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles . &quot;

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate moon light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color ton@@ ing correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of le@@ aching a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ ia oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; add tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . it trans@@ forms the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce trans@@ forms it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame , ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any location . this also goes in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool sten@@ cil , you can place a template on a picture . &quot;
the menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates on a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ ous ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you must set your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder updates the thumb@@ strip of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is centered around the mouse position . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; small : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the mouse position . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produced especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digit@@ alization process colours with only minimal differences to a colour point . this , in turn , results in sharp edges closer to a common colour . S@@ LR cameras normally require shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often used to have internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in rough format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers are already using a depth of field while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo using the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . this allows you to call shar@@ pen@@ ing with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; they should be careful with this , as the results do not seem very natural : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most suitable technique to shar@@ pen one image re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it can be shar@@ pen@@ ed . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft draw and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the mixed image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use of difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence beauty defects in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example for the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ ission @-@ Filter -@@ algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur@@ ry mask .
&quot; in practice , the circular circuit works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse der Gau@@ ß &apos; folding is actually very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . the resulting undes@@ irable results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular circuit . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in the correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are very rare . however , values higher than 0.1 are very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still further contam@@ inate the image . &quot;
&quot; pal@@ ate sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your Un@@ ity Gau@@ ß is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the trans@@ formations matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ ate . note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the storage as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter that you have set is stored for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you are reading pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
&quot; theore@@ tically , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better when processing small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regulator smoothing the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink tin@@ ts allow a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; Detail@@ er@@ restra@@ int p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image . weigh@@ ting larger values mainly makes homo@@ geneous regions smooth and details sharp . a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should always be necessary . &quot;
&quot; motion dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoothing . set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm is passed . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle measuring range da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More about quality that you receive by selecting this option is low . it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to allow it out .
the buttons storage as and loading make exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; correction of image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el . &quot;
below you can see how image errors have been removed with minor art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
&quot; die &amp; digi@@ kam , noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce drau@@ lic noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot;
this tool provides selected image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ escent changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the picture . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the picture . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ulation of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which typically are more dist@@ orted , but also contam@@ in@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , can remove noise and phase j@@ itter on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool for soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft drawing and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; ash noise , film gra@@ ding , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ active digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture reproduction . the texture composition is carried out with another tool , the image error correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a low @-@ loss compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ actor quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed Picture . &quot;
the buttons storage as and loading make exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uni@@ formity noise is reduced .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera was captured on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scann@@ er@@ light and phot@@ op@@ aper . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixels of photos with a CCD camera gem , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality rough @-@ quality photos as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark@@ view . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark@@ er will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and will load it again in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help to correct the result within the picture . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all thumb@@ nail areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; aver@@ ages : an average of the neighboring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo formats , can often not light the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 for the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise lack effects can be caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color gra@@ ds and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation on a rough image that is done without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker &apos;s copyright . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection filter and with three more exposure to the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the grade of light rein@@ forcement at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection decreases the brightness of pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine adjustment of exposure to the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ance correction and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the picture .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion 4th grade . this value is stronger than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners &apos; has the revers@@ ed sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value returns the image size and thereby correc@@ ts the first degree of gravity . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
&quot; bright : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as default values . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ onn@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Trans@@ forming trimm@@ ing from image processing or via the Zoom controller of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as photos from the front , frames and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters to simul@@ ate film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gra@@ ding and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the processed picture under ( 2 ) . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; this is known from classical high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ined view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , then you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large images . smooth checked the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the image is lab@@ eled with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines , which define the outlines in the drawing , are emphasized . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sket@@ ch yourself . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size , and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoothing ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can still be improved by adapting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filter engra@@ ver is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ stro@@ y landscape . &quot;
&quot; depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving fil@@ e. the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Un@@ ity effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ ity : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ ity : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by turning the pixels at a point . this simul@@ ates the Un@@ ity of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ red : wi@@ pe the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographic camera . &quot;
&quot; soften@@ ing Un@@ ity : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
sho@@ oter : wi@@ pe the picture by random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the Un@@ ity of an arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
smart Un@@ ity : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your picture . this gives natural your images a nice look . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size is not automatically growing with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use the tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction through mirrors or turning . the tools can be found in the &quot; &quot; Transform@@ ational Rot@@ ate &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Transform@@ ational Spi@@ ke &quot; &quot; menu . &quot;
photo blown is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transforming size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialogue is below .
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the buttons stored as and loading are used exactly for this purpose . every single extension for photo can be enlarged as a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ates is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; trimm@@ ing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a photo you simply have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the rect@@ angle size by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF sp@@ read@@ sheets so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the integration assistance allow you to hide help , so that you can better put your pictures together . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ el@@ re@@ gel , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf pet@@ als of a sunflower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of its two preceding numbers . &quot;
the golden centre provides more liquid relief lines when you put an image together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow on this type . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral mentioned above . their ver@@ tex points are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that , in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect of dynamic symmet@@ ry called by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve differently .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the relief lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it is easy to keep the camera upright or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with slider angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . once you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after turning a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function trans@@ former trimm@@ ing from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic trimm@@ ing . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you have to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new Width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is to cut the image with trans@@ former trimm@@ ing out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the sc@@ aling tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is not rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by transforming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; you can switch horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ering , the image will wi@@ pe a little . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two scre@@ enings generate twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after firing , the image has unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ former trimm@@ ing out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; needs a number of libraries and other pack@@ ets to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; this is done using the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file in the image processing will be displayed . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when it is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour , very helpful instructions in English . you can download rough format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that come from &amp; digi@@ ous ; supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editor program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in capabilities to display or edit movies .

many tools you need the photo editing need to be included in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description will follow here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ ter , noise suppression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applicable quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current picture . on the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can push it in or move out with the mouse wheel . push C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the Pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be considered either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the palette palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Insert . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character , if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color pic@@ ker on the left .
&quot; &amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the graphical programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these knots )
&quot; further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graphs . &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you launch &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon file and open the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file is currently edited in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item settings k@@ graph@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance or display the graphs in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when starting the program , you can re@@ open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one side will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the renewal store page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has changed to the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graphs in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time a graph will be asked .
the session management page gives you the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose from different &amp; graphical , layout algorithms . entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of directed graphs . the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and turns the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene ) . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module can read images to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the S@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; by scanning the menu entry image , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the given default duc@@ ts to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you can read the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the destination image appears . here you can specify compression and type of image file . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
&quot; you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the &quot; &quot; Import &quot; &quot; &gt; Screen photo menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen photo modes : &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management in the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos in the world to show the photos of your camera and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the module export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is thus quasi your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have cli@@ cked on Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will appear in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for two times , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current per@@ missions that the module is showing . for up@@ loading , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button Add images should be pressed once you have all other options set . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a remote browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed , which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracks are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . is the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS lies , you can put these limits here and then press the button Kor@@ rel@@ ing for inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog shows the coordinates from a call to the next one , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the shown map . select the region and enlarge . select the region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here &apos;s a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to facilitate the best internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you will need to select these albums only . in the field below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image you create a page creates a gallery in which each image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your related images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth you can change the default color depth , which naturally influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module creates the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ eri@@ sts . it was developed for fast frame display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of color information takes place . this can also be found in the PNG format as well . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation right now . if you are interested in writing , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then go to the import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module also uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can start creating the module using Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images selected from you are then listed in the portfolio image files , where you can also change the images or contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind as soon as possible .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all the settings to your preferences , you can use the button coding the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the button settings right down . &quot;
the printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo formats . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module directly .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quality of it is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results , as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switches have no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or further use it elsewhere , you should not select the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting button to start converting . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are secure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the options available are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image . for this purpose four types of image modification are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportions : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will appear with the images selected by you . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add the list of images to be sent .
&quot; to remove images , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
do not make sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the File Format File format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to low @-@ loss formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically be started at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want your slideshow to be displayed . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL Transi@@ tions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant images via Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option displays that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect at each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you entered information when you have entered your images and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images in addition to the names , select the button on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . please note that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you must select the image viewer window ( in closer ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you access the search in the main window , a dialog appears which is very similar to the dialog for fixing the image properties . you can view this dialog at once . &quot;
&quot; the date can either be part of the total database , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather try to try out some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tions videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the first dialog , select the demo in case you launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select from the menu help menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline lets you use the following ways inter@@ actively : you can change the displayed list view view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select a range , you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following section of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three main areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the survi@@ vor and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . see more about the export files . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . so you can avoid that information is displayed , which are obvious to the viewer even without description . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page , you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image larger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added at the next time . this allows you to choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . so the import function , see , properly works , you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with these . you can of course create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a double way . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file directory . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images can be viewed , which you can access via the File Export ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; in the Manu@@ ell option , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the images in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
&quot; the Wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import pictures are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window , which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they are in your database . &quot;
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example can be seen on the image .
&quot; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will see the various steps taken from ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , about ( 2 ) searching and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been launched as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today your videos are being dealt with . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and uses it automatically at future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , you can start a different folder tree with images , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will see the different settings . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group set up once in a group rather than all groups of a member like in . &quot;
&quot; in the list of options listed above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window you can select the category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; but they are sold separately . most modules , however , have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always first test new modules with the demo database before using it on your own images . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums . also when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order according to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , it will do so if you have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select modules to load modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . below the tool@@ bar you see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture , where the image is taken . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again , if you have information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by making the names used upwards , find the people faster and classi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments . in this case click on the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture to the top right . &quot;
&quot; if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort this item in alphabe@@ tical order . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking on and moving the bar , the top edge of the frame , and move it out of a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... , which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to display this window again later , use the button Options ... and here then window / hide . this process will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can see the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and hit either the delete button , or select Edit selection in the Edit selection menu . now , the window will show you that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , you can use the images somewhere , so that you can record the photo album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the images 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it into it . if you want to avoid anger like the m@@ ess of your pictures , please buy a larger disk to save all pictures on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu below you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter out the images that you want to make for others accessible and click on Current View in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also tick all the images that your little sister may see , cont@@ acting and choose the menu entry All apart from current view . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in case of your little sister . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu Privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is not very safe . for one , all images on the hard drive and the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are not very familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with this is natural , of course , that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . he of course shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily pull it with the mouse and move elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the pop @-@ up menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image after a few seconds . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . you can drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button , you can drag the mouse to the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation button , the zoom sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos that come in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste are .
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and look at more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you are one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in this case you can see a picture in which the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have set features on your images , you can see them in the browser . so , if you have selected all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to display categories in dre preview , you can simply press the characters for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch off the painting from the context menu , select the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object in the wire model views are shown yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu Insert . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; - enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL account documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in Property View and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as pres@@ et@@ ting , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a tex@@ tured element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag and drop those check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility Level as a wi@@ re@@ model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you want . you can also save multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the start to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anch@@ ored at the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the Map Le@@ aders at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the start to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing at the top pointing arrow in the optic line . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the Cham@@ bers bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it anywhere . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window order ... save it . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene . &quot;
&quot; a rendering mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the &quot; &quot; The render settings &quot; &quot; icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each rendering mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination feld quality , you can select the properties that are used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections illumination . a detailed description of the rendering properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is continually sub@@ divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that can be followed individually and on further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the record can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which comp@@ utes diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the corresponding rays have not hit the object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ends , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the file import file ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command circum@@ ference of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or warnings occur , a dialog box shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also in your editor . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can adjust the object number of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to the projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you indicate a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you indicate the bottom , a bottom is rendered below the object . the bottom is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the edge of the edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold values . more details about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section , you will explain how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the add @-@ on button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the add @-@ on button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , anchor the window under the existing window , with card card , you get a map view together with the previous view and floating anchor the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a bullet on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not include light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed all error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when you click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( inser@@ ting final body qui@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a simple method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then click App@@ ly or En@@ ter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands until the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise one unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how the object is to be inserted . you can change the name in the property tree ( name = base pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the thumb@@ nail preview you can see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment only shows a matt black material because you can still preview the pig@@ ment settings . &quot;
&quot; if you preview no color on the header and ball in the preview , click App@@ ly on App@@ ly and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ ame your image with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color you have expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select the colors in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should simply run this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood . the ball can be just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to use the En@@ ter or button App@@ ly ) , so the ball would float above the ground , since you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , place a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first choose Under@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click sphere pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish features : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are offered to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ sourcing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ one command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit undo .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the short@@ cuts . you can modify or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands using this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give color to the surface of an object color on pixel base by applying an image file as color chart .
&amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return button .
&quot; you can set whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; in the setting up - &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; when you exit the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types are displayed which can display the program .
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determine whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider and the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; in the map cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short description .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Photo processing based on the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reporting problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then , we would like to answer you questions about other users . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; and show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over your work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you must select in the menu settings show@@ photo ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . the same page strip is also available in the image processing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; channel ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than scan images and save images .
&quot; &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not do more than images , to save images and save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; with the command line channel -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to use , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
&quot; to add an image , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the pre @-@ scan can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image is saved and lie ? en leads to a departure and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the knob settings dialog , the dialog box will open in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving has to be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way you wish to save images . open dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save saving without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images in the option save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as a default for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it using the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that is recorded each time an image is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button over starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; channels .

&quot; at the bottom , you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button into the player window and set up Global Keyboard Short@@ cuts . you can set up the key short@@ cuts by clicking the right mouse button into the player window and set short commands . &quot;
you may set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog , so the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos;@@ exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your script data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should include any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . this is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change signals that a new piece is applied . the script could now query &amp; z@@ b , with D@@ CO@@ P functions to query more information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signal a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title covers the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages which the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the explan@@ atory amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is complete , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and hang the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attach . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title for thousands of your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the choice is still hard , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to type the following in the base folder of Amar@@ ok source to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when you compile it . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies have to be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without trouble using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards for setting up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; to view player windows , the player window will switch to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is disabled , only the playlist will be displayed . &quot;
use the tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the m@@ ood@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; create voice files with the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
&quot; save playlist while saving , saves the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the piece , the play@@ lists window appears / down to keep the current play always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing to the context browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is applied . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . press on Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . &quot;
&quot; playback when starting , causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece at the place where it has been stopped at the last exit . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is hoo@@ ked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD to be sh@@ aded .
&quot; your own colors will give you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog to select color selection . if the colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colours are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to appear the O@@ SD . &quot;
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate other settings in this map .
the map collection is used to set all settings for your collection . it contains the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . &quot;
&quot; Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music . &quot;
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all the play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected yet another set @-@ up in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is needed .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l @-@ Setup section is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : if the network port is entered , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the map load .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send pieces played and thus update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activation of this setting is called &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be accessed at each played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager is keeping the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will function , for example , difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
&quot; most of the times , Tag@@ lib is crashing when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . disable when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens when a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a info , but do not label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / re@@ petition / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known fault in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects will be forgotten under the visual symbols Advanced . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so adjust that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some ways . most of the installation problems are ligh@@ test by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist . how do you get into music ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window was converted to the statistic window . you can find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press the Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist from the drop down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them drop there , just like you would do it with other files . &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , the playlist can be saved . click on it . &quot;
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual ; this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the Back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost any only imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 decoder in default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be reached by a sound card using hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
the output of this command should help you search for the problem case and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
&quot; you can &apos;t simply send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , enco@@ des it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . the En@@ lar@@ ging of Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . follow the follow @-@ up register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . in addition the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to bed . &quot;
how to find the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running title when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows can be separated . click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the En@@ ter button after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
&quot; my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console . what is now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal read , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the piece has been played , the less influence has each individual review on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the evaluation for one piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select Review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want to show you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that will not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok that some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon when playing in general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool@@ bars to set up ... and make the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click on New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok , while browsing in the Con@@ quer@@ or . then click Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information that pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and also a lot of error reports . &quot;
presum@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you must now install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad module is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module also needs to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 @-@ Stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
setup Amar@@ ok ... audio output enter the device . typically for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio input , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card support m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed care professional for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be very simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard that will be shown at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . use the mouse to save entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it using the playlist of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , then you can select the playlist to import play@@ lists . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have different ways to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed , which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current track , bit rate and sample rate of the current unit . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , there are also the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL knob activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the button E@@ Q is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . use the playback buttons to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classics to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the check box equ@@ ali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side of the navigation . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser features different information about the current unit . its appearance can be adapted with context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window starts off . the information presented here is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . in addition , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpreter and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information about the current play . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
&quot; the images can have arbitrary names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferred . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , fo@@ als , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the suggested pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can adjust which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . click the right mouse button anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the performer , lists all albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be up and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing instantly . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button opens a search for google.com following the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ts / album - first the pieces are sorted by interpre@@ ts , and this is the best view of your collection . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group Performer / year - album - sort by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - alb@@ um@@ name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically sorted by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by interpreter .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something to the selected folder . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . references to using this filter can be found in the playlist section of this manual . &quot;
&quot; the search filter is a selection field with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time frames , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ dges the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ es - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
&quot; to transfer the pieces to the media player , add the pieces to the media player . see the Media Player Browser section for more details . &quot;
&quot; if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; select a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear among different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will need to find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all the files are hidden that will not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL . for example , if you are using tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simple dro@@ pping . in the case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert random files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then change the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will include Mike Old@@ field after entries , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the key@@ word : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; for example , Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side , you will find the Add that you can add to the playlist . to the right , you find playlist saving , playlist blank and vulnerable M@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; next , follow the buttons back and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the that you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist . it displays the title of the current unit , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . for this , disable the option status bar in general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the playlist in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plugins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in your collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to be displayed in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your great entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece in the playlist , then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist , or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details of the set up of these are later ) . &quot;
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on it and then select loading . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix instantly fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist has to be added to the next piece , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
&quot; re@@ plen@@ ish the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be able to hear it double in this playlist . &quot;
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , you can add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists attached . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new scripts in which a script package can be installed to install . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also fetch new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization plugins will be used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide is intended to show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other low @-@ loss compressed formats , remember that you will receive a low quality audio CD , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD is created by a low @-@ loss format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide is intended to show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please copy Extras , CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have made all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original image is completed into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media to which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

the Q@@ T @-@ Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plugins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , where you can get feedback from the forums and learn more . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions , which also offers &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality in burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard stage , e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different record levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the software you need to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue save under will be displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for every single project file Save .
&quot; close the current project . if a project has been changed and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; close all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project that is not stored , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and completed &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project not stored , it will be asked what should happen as if you were called File Cl@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ennen , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it causes them to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you can see files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
&quot; this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can later burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which you can later burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . therefore , the target medium needs to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned down immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; a previously created DVD image burns . the dialogue asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used in the table . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , enco@@ ding settings , and even options to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will appear in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media @-@ Info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
the Content View enables selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs when a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view .
&quot; the head@@ board is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change button assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general programming settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled e.g. via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function scope , therefore more likely your taste and the type of your task are crucial , which of the attached programs you give preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) void er@@ ase@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternative can be obtained using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String ) void _ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Items ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Items ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Items ( Q@@ String Path ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then insert files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Excellent for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the GUI of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ding these WAV files ( compressed ) by default ( These enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the enco@@ der packages are installed that are needed . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting @-@ up has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily usage for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is captured manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of the main window commands .
&quot; ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if enco@@ der has been configured in the enco@@ der tab in the setup directory - enco@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of enco@@ ders available so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the default . it must be noted that the enco@@ der in the enco@@ der tab has been configured in the setup dialog before .
&quot; open the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main installation dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different card cards ( such as Enco@@ der , for setting enco@@ ders ) . you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both codes are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues &quot;
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit rates ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music from young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the CD ; information which is entered manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch @-@ tt must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves in the computer . it is to be noted that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged . any information can be obtained anyway during a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this may only know the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updating the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the read @-@ out WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the enco@@ der tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; needs to be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc . ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; please check the cover of the CD ; this won &apos;t be successful !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup and start our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 words ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have permission to do it ( eg ; by trying to copy something in with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each aper@@ ture &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD , if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map general settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; just select in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed if data for the creation of keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the map CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data can automatically be downloaded from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change the directory name and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the two selection fields , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the CD . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . place everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work as equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls can boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . if you do not want to make this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; just type in as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is something long , under certain circumstances something must be blind@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags to Version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of wa@@ v files at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD runs ; we will create and setup MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was set up in the previous section , because we are comfortable and the CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described . &quot;
&quot; because we use a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , see screen@@ shots a bit different from that for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b retri@@ eved data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen shot . this only when the CD could be identified ; as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then look for questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD was successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all songs are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Current title &apos; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you don &apos;t just start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current unit . the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark before each row of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or press the button All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button selection read out the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the posts and track what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab assignments for switching to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der , which you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : mandate 4 is the enco@@ ding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is already installed . install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you are reading this , you probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people who compile source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
a program that calls for many different programs has many variations of settings . the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; Hi , still reading am ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first startup of the program , without any cl@@ ue as to go on from that somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program start no audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can not maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for whoever wants to add something useful or change it , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke Player by &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag and drop in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; when you exit and k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button down in the tool@@ bar , select the item from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played afterwards . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive through and forth with the knob . &quot;
&quot; when you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the speed display and change the playback speed . to get the original speed again , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item break in the menu item , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics eig@@ nis and other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed , and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so that you don &apos;t have to manually set the automatic text selection . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select the entries for text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find them in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the selected winn@@ ings in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection takes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Auto Add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the still open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song , then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to ski@@ p a song , select the next song , enter next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button previous piece , the item Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map converts general @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ LE are ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
there are no programs to create MIDI Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ...
see that DE@@ F@@ INE is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
&quot; in this section , the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a rif@@ le for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a rif@@ le . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of whatever sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , where each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of ever the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to depic@@ t sounds on the percussion channel . take a look at the key@@ maps provided .
&quot; this section can be used to train some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and the second channel , simply make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch B@@ ender Event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that will play a pitch @-@ b@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pian@@ os you see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button g@@ lows no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played notes . view the Settings menu under the heading channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices at very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before that , enable the Automatic Add to Collection Setup . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed you can double click on the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; move windows and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the setting Automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . open files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Málaga . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to write MIDI files , make music and prove pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll send you a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and didn &apos;t get money from anybody for it . I would like to emphasize that I only want to keep programming , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - fixing the bug that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; my thanks also includes Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or just a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on his homepage which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ ons , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional assistance , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you select an entry , your group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current play &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also through the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you must select the playlist with playlist and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost , when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some features can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation during starting and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp;
there is a Ri@@ der to configure M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the dat@@ enst@@ ro@@ ms from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
&quot; there is no tab for this device in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything needs to be configured through manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec mo@@ zilla is played : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even paste the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to enable the &amp; KM@@ Player , &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end issue is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , several names are used by KM@@ Player for sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ed , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there indications how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be tested on its performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; K@@ ile .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be taken back to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the Linux ; -@@ distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the c@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are included . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact should be made via the C@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when compile &amp; K@@ ile , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to experience the manual for Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . choosing the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
&quot; if there is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book to be able to master ; good books , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the \ \ begin { document } command , and must be closed with the \ \ begin { document } command , and must be closed with the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the quick entry assistant of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; documentation classes : this allows the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom @-@ defined . &quot;
coding : this is set to set the character enco@@ ding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . if UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X is used ( for the correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t need to worry about this . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically generated a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings K@@ ile ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into a number of elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ divided element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex , files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file is created , jump &amp; K@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the commercial output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite is spr@@ inkl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is displayed on the &quot; &quot; guard &quot; &quot; part , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick assembly . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ size selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields were developed for quick inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the selection field Fur@@ ther is for the introduction of articles such as words , notes , notes or references . the available possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a fixed name ( selection over a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font details . it can be specified for the main text , the floor notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font details . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of men@@ Ã ¼ s building or but@@ ton@@ hole . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically records storage .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors during logging . when using quick @-@ building , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font name 12 is created and only a few addresses should have a different font . &quot;
the changes are made only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no address ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. are added . these commands can be added either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is intended for the cur@@ sive print and is until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be represented in ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language , now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide will follow the creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , there should be a quote , a few places in fat and ital@@ ics , and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , you can return to the editor using Editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text , the conversion can begin by using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preliminary search allows the direct jump from the editor to the added position inside the DVI ; file .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . for this , only modern settings must be set up under Settings . &quot;
&quot; to search for the pre @-@ search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and can be cli@@ cked on pre @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer takes place then . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; open and spr@@ inkl@@ ed to the corresponding line .
&quot; if using quick @-@ installation of the &amp; DVI ; viewers do not open , an error can be found . if an error is present , it is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file er@@ ects the source code in the source code . in the editor you can then use the short@@ com@@ ings of the La@@ Te@@ X error and legacy La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the error has to be cli@@ cked to the error in logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the error line . &quot;
&quot; once on the relevant button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be re @-@ written from scratch or used to quickly create a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; c@@ ages Users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or create a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and select file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a file , some strings may be replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... Settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps will be completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of default . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described under described steps should be executed .
&amp; k@@ ate ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and writing of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual for Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , and their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that you select only \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards can add additional spr@@ int marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu item is highlighted , or the corresponding keyboard short@@ ens the jump to the next or last jump mark . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities offer , have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; specific commands for their selection . &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides an empty line ) . with a paragraph , there is not a text with persistent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only beu@@ tiful thing in &amp; K@@ ile ; is that the verses are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also contains lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands with a return string ( \ \ ) and a supplementary star ( * ) are selected at the end . &quot;
&quot; to remove a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been revealed that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit surroundings for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command is spra@@ yed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command will be spra@@ yed at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to open the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted surrounding commands , the over@@ looks can quickly be lost . this command stops the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not crushed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . &quot;
this command will be spra@@ yed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ led bracket .
with this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded closing bracket .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the cur@@ led bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a large number of scre@@ ened groups cl@@ as@@ ps , the over@@ looks can quickly be lost . this command will close the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be dissi@@ p@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple add @-@ on marks are used as a guest for the purpose . for the purpose of the application , the sign is &quot; used . &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and provides two closing notes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double bond mark can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; you can also use certain specific settings ( e.g. , German or french ) , and there@@ with German or French appeal characters . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when pressing Shift ; En@@ ter , enter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; K@@ ile ; not just a line break but at the same time the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added to La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ulator in the above line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already has a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; there are several modes ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment with the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and possible gener@@ ously conce@@ als the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; K@@ ile ; also jump marks can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing the most common jump brand and the weigh@@ ted parameters can then be incorporated . &quot;
under settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different forum lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher of general language used .
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of full mode will result in a large list of environmental commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for completing environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full operation mode over the menu , or the key Alt + Shift key , the command will be automatically opened to open the environment and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient failure can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the key button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once you notice that it is a list environment , there is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the registry listing of full @-@ time mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; supports custom lists of irrit@@ ation , which can be replaced immediately by temporary strings . the lists can be set up under settings k@@ ile ... ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the code L is entered and the word is introduced over the men@@ Ã ¼ Edi@@ ting mode or key@@ word C@@ tr@@ l + Alt neutral button , the code L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; big wo@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ers are not helpful for automatic operation . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ers are written in a document more than once . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu settings . here , too , the threshold value for displaying the damage can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Personal Home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the graphics capture the graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and respected . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to enable the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed group@@ wise in the menus , comp@@ iling , converting , and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source text for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ ages Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file using Alt ; 4 can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Build command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , there will be a new window each time . &quot;
a new project will discuss the project New Project . for this purpose the following information will be asked for the project :
&quot; when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows the removal of EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be administered over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes documentation for the included packages and another lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a full manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands are therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; extra@@ di@@ ted , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for parcel names or keywords . by &amp; K@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source code editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; put@@ ex ; &amp; K@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; K@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; also installed on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the progress of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we can use all under consideration of the GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; the version 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML , tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use comm@@ itting as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a sub@@ strate . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de , knows my opinion and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it one piece , we give it a graphic interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the sub@@ merged working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files ; files are deleted each time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select current working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then the current file is simply hoo@@ ked . if not , delete the check file in the current file and select the file to be verified using other file types . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the well @-@ formed revision selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; application tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already marked , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or part , we start using the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the plugins included and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; item in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project involves multiple people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the buttons as pressed . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important regarding messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the collection of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see in that such ladder will be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; to enter notes is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or entered the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word in a comment field , followed by comment text . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) plays a role in the project from the following options : team leader Sub@@ project manager After the area and sub@@ project leaders , the corresponding area or sub@@ project names should be given as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supported web@@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can thus be changed . entries are :
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close Tags : when hoo@@ ked , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , it is inserted immediately after &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; not optional tags close : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; update the start and end tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding coding while typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . the default default values can be restored using the default button .
default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or in a different way than with File opening open files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here is excluded from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies , so with a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the standard back on the next start is useful when the user interface has come across by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree using the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are Part @-@ Applications of the third page , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , at the best @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not at a stand@@ ar like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Read mode &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied loading . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the input information is correct . select , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of it , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included . &quot;
&quot; using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button , next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in box , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is shown . normally appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . normally appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower D@@ ock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will trigger the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that no attention has to be paid in the normal case . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; exec@@ uting the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will proceed . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; exec@@ uting the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will proceed . if it happens before a request is requested , the execution begins as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible into functions and include files will be cleaned . &quot;
&quot; re@@ jects the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over the instruction and go to the next , as if there would be the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value can be set to a variable . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on http : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith . &quot;
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag files contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders are handy , symbol@@ ised bars of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions more quickly insert into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without danger of a type@@ writer . &quot;
tag files are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder names the name of the description language and version so available . ( for example html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but nothing else . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has an common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
put a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling the tag in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cut and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example once for each one ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( for example one for each one ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is an element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ained properly and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files is the Tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check is only performed when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Excel function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D adap@@ table DT@@ D settings . so you can edit di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; general &#93; version = default 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action to create the same dialog :
&quot; this action assigned keyboard short@@ cuts . by clicking the User defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text will be inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . using this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Schnell@@ start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . this way , the script tries to locate $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we are sub@@ stituted with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the default input . in the selection field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , written to the default output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written to the default output , by setting the value in the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the suitable tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , in case the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable dialog &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; when available , so that you can input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , fixed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ - tag in the current document is inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog through settings tool@@ bars . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by tasting all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; backup to the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most popular extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 11.@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that sub @-@ folders are in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent at the top end of the tree view and m@@ d@@ ash ; folders are displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ scripts would display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of shared context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now , you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different locations , you can send a menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useless for publishing . to make a contribution to the source of resources , we recommend the source of resources , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , investig@@ ates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is un@@ signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tag@@ XML format . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that the following dialog appears :
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion , the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter attempts to famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars over actions , everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then can be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local items represent a personal collection of Web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local items are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ ners , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please note , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cartridge with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , like closing the current , other or all flash@@ backs , re@@ charge , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or run CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , help the word under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string under the mouse poin@@ ter is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that represents the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . now , you can fill the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog various fields . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate and navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and stre@@ ak them . in the representation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the breakdown in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces quickly . the content @-@ oriented in@@ let system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two flash@@ backs at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the check of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for that auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid Web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us started to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ ours is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ er Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ description , so they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting . &quot;
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
turn the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script exec@@ utes error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structural tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details . &quot;
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... are saved using tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where any other can access it . see in . &quot;
download a DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be re@@ plen@@ ished , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tag menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus .
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by means of tools is denied when this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plugin menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu items listed above . click on it . click on a enabled plug @-@ in de@@ activated . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax output mode for the current file . the list of available survey schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switch the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser . &quot;
judge the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the mouse &apos;s environment , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be filled up from top to bottom , since the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be termin@@ ated with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the server address of the machine to which you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ .com ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in ser@@ vers@@ ed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included , if a project is started anew , not a hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder , and you can make a precise selection of coup@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want through hooks or , by removing the check , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profile or shift Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which will be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high loading profiles can be set ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view to the server &apos;s content for each profile by drag@@ ging your own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration window , event actions can be switched on and add these actions , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project , which was opened . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folders are just as well , but the entries open and open with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is low to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about programmers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk does not store the option . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the Menu Project or the Project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best explained above the menu tool@@ bar . using and adding distingu@@ ishes itself . adding tool@@ bars is treated at the bottom of the tool@@ bar section . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can either be set using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bar can be removed , tool@@ bar keys or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars are to be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action works , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up the tool@@ bar settings in the menu ... and set settings for actions .
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
&quot; documents can be written by any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment over a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , compiled in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure as desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File Now save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . view the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File Add as template to save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and laying on the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag@@ ging and storing or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files view of a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and backup . by default , it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ enter head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the master folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set so , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general header lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows by copying content templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , using context menu ( pointing out right mouse button ) via a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which is accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ bt of &amp; PHP ; -@@ Source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cur@@ sor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , this mode is already active , the button will offset the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; assuming that you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . &quot;
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the content , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules are currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button , selecting the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is possible like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculi@@ arly . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of button or removal key . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or lists wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need other than &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned post@@ ures can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g comp@@ utes the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a period file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire match is checked with a template named QNAP or a specified mod@@ us@@ name . &amp; eg ; template matches any my@@ QNA@@ P@@ ME that contains the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a raised stopping point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merged . &quot;
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later any amount of further useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three Qu@@ ell files when merged :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o Target Fol@@ der k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Target Fol@@ ders
&quot; opening dialog shows the manual typ@@ ing of file names , the selection via the file browser ( File ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; on the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merge of folders will be introduced . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , then use a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if the merge is crossed , the input field will be active and can be processed . however , it is not essential to immediately set a output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting to merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . &quot;
note : currently you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag@@ ging and inser@@ ting text into another program as cut@@ out and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the Info line of the source pane contains the character A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the abstr@@ action column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the file name and &#91; change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the kno@@ bs on the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , every difference at the same time is a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump of the position in the windows where the beginning of the group is otherwise not visible ) .
&quot; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; text &amp; lt ; Con@@ trac@@ tual conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources to ignore the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the screen bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , end , tr@@ g beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion key , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over @-@ write mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and manually copying the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are using a line @-@ feed @-@ character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the lin@@ eup + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line length of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of last files used will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; choose a type@@ face with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the selected font does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically adjust@@ s an odd colour . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the respective number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press the input or return , the return of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , every selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy it to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the default setting is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; looking for even smaller differences , the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will appear before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter for scanning folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation to compare and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original app@@ ended . if there is already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if enabled , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
the enco@@ ding fields for coding appears a short notice of what the local enco@@ ding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different enco@@ ding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can set the enco@@ ding of the output command commands . &quot;
&quot; ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will appear next to the normal yet another over@@ sight column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge operation and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is only used in line comparison . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line comparison to convert the input in capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a stimul@@ us expression of the text found on each string . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
the \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ very character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually er@@ ased . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform multiple compositions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ Aff@@ dings are in per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous \ \ &apos; example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for the display and to merge . other operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm will see .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line comparison pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hides differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case you destroy important data . &quot;
often programmers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... &quot; makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start , &quot;
... can simul@@ ate the merge and show the simulated changes without really performing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will receive a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the file scanning , only the files that have been compared to that point are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and folder of the scan found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by double clicking on the + / - , or using the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can fold or fold all folders . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file extension is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the name in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist cannot run the merge .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then select the necessary action , so afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange may not be eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file is processed after the other . it status column displays he@@ el when the merge was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full @-@ time analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all matching actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified any destination folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode is used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge B , B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries in the destination folder should be displayed , even in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries , select Direc@@ tories Fol@@ ders start / continue in the menu menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only perform the current entry , select action of the current item or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still invalid merge actions exist , a message appears that points to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options to run , simul@@ ate and cancel . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real change . then , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are ready with a file , select a directory merge again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries will not be added once again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged once again . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set to a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage is a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the confidentiality of the modification date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the ch@@ angel@@ ing date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . the results of the merge of files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of combining the copy of the newer file as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it is assumed that the other file is not changed too . ) This option is disabled in default . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ original extension already exists , it will also be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible during the merge of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a single file without having to run the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be set up and the file will not be merged once you launch the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
&quot; a path may be relatively und@@ am@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can &apos;t be differentiated if a link shows a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change are devi@@ ated from the original . ( note the confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch will start to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . also , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; being executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ are ) . moreover , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 program from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find further information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is a story is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this has so far been too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de , 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you can find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) to the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; this also causes identical files to be copied not to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the marking A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the respective window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button again . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual desktop environments . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop , change its size , change it or move it . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop environments as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and can even be moved on the desktop and on the other .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other work@@ tops . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on : when on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager up ... and Finish . if however click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and exit . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual desktop buttons are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of the virtual desktop . if it is crossed along with name , the names will be provided with ordin@@ al numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working area . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is ti@@ cked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal row and vertical right in a vertical range , which is very good for representation on the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set up sel@@ ector switches ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have permission for the file , you must log in as a user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is k@@ de@@ base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly being expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; when you launch &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in default , it increases &amp; k@@ not ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can port@@ ray a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; you want to avoid that the cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor position . please note that the mouse cur@@ sor is not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you also press the &amp; Shift key , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can post@@ p@@ one the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firmly and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stop the display update . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and res@@ ize &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use an area of screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which each mouse click prepares pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is stuck for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who are suffering at the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by the moving of the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can execute drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . this way you can execute drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this dwell time must be logged after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; is Intel@@ lig@@ ently switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before it leaves the mouse button again , if no logging occurs during the time . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but it can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to sh@@ orten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there &apos;s a slider Sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , becomes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set by opening the dialog . if you already pressed the button , the settings will be reset after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart shifting should be switched off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later push the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should make aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , which does not display a link , does not result in unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent move in this case , it means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you even run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to have it . however , parking the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a ke@@ yp@@ ad . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent reloc@@ ation is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy text , to copy it to the clip@@ board , or perform any other action in which you want to make the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent delay if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : hold a mouse click at the end of the text area and keep the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . by this , each time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button p@@ ushes a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . however , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case in most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor res@@ ides . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which prepares the mouse button pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process , before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and laying with the mouse can also be done . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computers speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select phrases that are to be spoken again from a list with the conversation course . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text@@ book . from the text passages , you can often select used text passages without having to typ@@ ing them . of course , the passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) , you determine the dictionary for the word @-@ passing language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly book@@ marked words can be included in the Wor@@ th Edition . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your phrases ( the bottom white box in the screen photo ) and a run memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have done k@@ mouth ; correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the default memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the side of the word and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map output voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box under the input field , you specify the character enco@@ ding to be passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as default input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with Pos@@ si@@ bly t@@ act as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text passages or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of In stock , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the storage memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field closing the editing window for text passages , you can specify if the text passages book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to save changes , the text@@ book is not saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the dictionary page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word transi@@ tions . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word transi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the required language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; the frequency of individual words is simply determined by enum@@ eration of the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , insert a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text passages is two . in the upper part the text@@ books are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or through a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the screen saver . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation file . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a postpon@@ able tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is ordered by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sophisticated left side and drag@@ ging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with cl@@ ues about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a postpon@@ able bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is positioned above the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sophisticated left side and drag@@ ging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; most likely you have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a voice @-@ edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows it to use festival free of charge and without further restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without further restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ etts directory . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since setting the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use Pos@@ si@@ bly kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak text through the computer . a list of already spoken phrases can be saved , which the user can always re@@ print . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer contains . on the computer a speech synthes@@ izer needs to be installed .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows every application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; reading texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded . &quot;
&quot; the voice output takes place via the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ utility .
&quot; Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; speech mark@@ up language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS Services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setting of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the list via https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and properly set program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the flash@@ card will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card is displayed in General . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those who differ in volume or speed . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are similar to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the flash@@ card leader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the flash@@ card speaker will appear . this will also appear automatically when you launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no spokes@@ person is set up . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred actors will appear at the top of the list . the top speaker will be used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the spokes@@ man from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the or@@ ator in the list determines also its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ale system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a young female and female voice . &quot;
&quot; click Edit . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one or@@ ator installed , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de . click the General tab in General to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card is displayed and you can create text orders and read the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can start text orders , stop , stop and res@@ ume . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab in General and select language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text you want to read and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web site . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ head@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the enhanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text you want to read , and choose the text output in the main menu . then , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events set out by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up different types of messages , for example , to set up a message when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nickname is present . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy vary depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the content of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from messages sent by e @-@ mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited before it is sent to speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain defects of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the output of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order that you initiate from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text applications are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such template reads , this issue is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; strings replacing parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions , which allow the creation of chat @-@ em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the form@@ alization of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included are some X@@ S@@ LT files for the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the flash@@ card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is used for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not true , the text remains unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; - Noti@@ fication on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is edited by all activated filters that were set up on the page . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and you will see the next set @-@ up di@@ alogs below . &quot;
&quot; for setting character strings , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , you just have to distinguish yourself from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is executed in the shown order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs are available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you are allowed to enter only copies . &quot;
&quot; the string reduction filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box , if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( blan@@ ks ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls package . &quot;
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conversion . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific person who is set up on the flash@@ card speaker or to a speaker with certain properties . you can , for example , specify that texts should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is transferred to the filter , it looks for a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected according to the spokes@@ man characteristics that the program proposes , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it by clicking the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions above , the speaker is selected , which meets the required requirements . click on the button to the right to display the dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the voice selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box of Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , where programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API with voice synthes@@ izer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output keys via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands :
&quot; open two &amp; console windows . first , start t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so SA@@ B@@ LE does not work at all . you must also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or inter@@ marks appear to cause errors to synthes@@ izer , so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ed . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character enco@@ ding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be corrected by a string reduction filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the accompanying documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices , which have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the source code of k@@ de@@ accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages on the project page http : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; KT@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a single console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or obsol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that is not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML conversion filter , but it is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for short@@ com@@ ings or downloaded each night currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; , which uses the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ GR program is to be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can return pun@@ ctu@@ ation , sentence , or cancel the output , stop or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; over , you can request the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a spokes@@ person whose language is English and its gender female , this will be used , otherwise it will automatically select the best suitable spokes@@ person . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ person sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click to add a speaker to the list on the map , and click Edit a speaker to the list or click Edit , the box map will be displayed for Festival Interactive . see below for details on the modules below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text , which is passed to festival . for voices , which &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages are using ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider , you adjust volume , voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice you choose does not allow you to adjust the settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes require several seconds to load . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is faster synthes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly to App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed set . the spokes@@ person ID corresponds to the ID column on the flash@@ card spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can proceed in the order that is selected in the list below , pre or reset . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
clicking on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if no output modules are used in the list , select at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; adjust the voice speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ ,@@ ; % approximately the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ale .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the requested jobs will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have priority priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that addresses messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the expenses of Screen Re@@ aders there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages can be read , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the map notification appears . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch to &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nickname in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is given in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts should do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the requested speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map viewer as the above entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the Save button to save the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button loading to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all notification area will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voice , speech , volume , sex of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ onic . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with reading , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you see the set limits filter automatically set up . you can change its settings or add another set of recognition filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; in the easiest way , you will learn how to set the voice selection by trying . switch off the speech selection and select text to read . switch on the cartridge list , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s choice is changed . &quot;
&quot; the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time . &quot;
&quot; you can then order or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal stat@@ ute recognition filter will automatically be set up when you launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything to this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
set limits recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ular symbols are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set @-@ recognition filter keeps the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ code ) , warnings , messages , or the output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from seeing the normal stat@@ ute recognition filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you can over@@ write speech settings for the application on the Cart@@ ridge menu . the map card is displayed , if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card reader ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
&quot; using the most suitable speaker , which has all the characteristics of a set speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the spokes@@ man who is most likely to comply with the originally set up character . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the kno@@ bs .
&quot; select the characteristics of the speaker you want . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case in which you might want to specify the attribute language is present if you know that a particular application is sent text in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the properties in the area spokes@@ person , which is best to delete the following , click the standard speaker drop @-@ down button and then use speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 means the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it starts . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , a non @-@ compliant version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall a stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices . as a guide , you can serve the other entries . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML converter filter , and set up the microphone . &quot;
&quot; I am not able to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus Festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file goes to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate character set @-@ up filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; I can &apos;t move forward or backwards . on the Kart@@ ei@@ reiter orders is displayed , the order consist only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;

&quot; before you use it ; first , check if your voice synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of Festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to type MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 bit ) enco@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . please search for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA , synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files .
&quot; in this procedure additional Wr@@ apper code will be added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder festival / lib / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS English Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; - Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of error correction is not required , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice @-@ location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with the I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . get up and install first festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both of them work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ pack the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .
download the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer , which currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with enough voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can either adjust pitch , volume or voice speed in this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ step speech synthes@@ izer , which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text in Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; speech synthesis is good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , voice speed , and volume over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slov@@ ak@@ ian language . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with enough voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; launch kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . click Add . click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS voice synthes@@ izer . if the epic programs do not stand in your PAT@@ H , enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; ep@@ os -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither pitch , volume nor voice speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a single console ; on the command line . &quot;
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Networking settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index option . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release date is best . by marking the setting of non @-@ re @-@ queries the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... setup in the device setup .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; by selecting Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the option Manual , the TCP / IP address can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can find out if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . disable the enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface ... &quot;
defines the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other networks .
&quot; if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain indication by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer users can only understand IP addresses . if the computer calls http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for nam@@ esp@@ ace part of the Rei@@ ter &apos;s name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry and ascending or gra@@ ding in the list with buttons down or down in priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Name Servers dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit ... It will display the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of name known calcul@@ ators describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address refer@@ r@@ als for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains especially well @-@ known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add ... Add New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias name , de button add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog you edit is displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately activated in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is enough ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second one will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf ; configur@@ able configuration files . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) are currently being operated . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently concentrating on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is as@@ cri@@ bed to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point that has a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP may not be selected as desired ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conf@@ lic@@ ting with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is any other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . a different stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when one sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ train the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat , you will be asked if the tape is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; detect &amp; k@@ dat ; the default , search for the matching index on your disk . if this is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the index is to be re @-@ created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape was involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; the band can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without danger , by changing the symbol for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this is done before you format a tape before using . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives do not do . &quot;
after entering the band name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after finishing the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically included and is ready to use .
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu bar ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test is started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears to be checked . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
&quot; once the recovery process is started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of the band :
&quot; as a result , a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created . you can set the following settings for a safety profile : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are stored that are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; performing an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be saved and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command mt the load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . it may not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when releasing the &amp; k@@ dat system ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy @-@ streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if a tape is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only record a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar files that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system re@@ stores the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that may be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first try to open the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol - this is not shown , and it opens itself instead of the system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no authorization to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion , or after entered strings . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry on this page . for example , the string of the filter search term is only available with entries in the corresponding column . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the stage errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the stage indication . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off input dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( for example in system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can ski@@ p the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new incoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log on the menu in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find further information about the sources of reference from &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system quickly develops to the standard for the control of program start when driving the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know anything about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and re@@ format . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead directly in / etc . this folder is named r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you would like to start when moving the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be located in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the starting field :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you restart the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually launch these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when it contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that runs only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n , or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ti@@ ser number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore items thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated if their configuration files are not present or wrong@@ ly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level to be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you will need to save them . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or save it in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double @-@ click on the entry . the dialog appears user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some map cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
the map administration will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
&quot; this map card only appears if for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( see the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the space restrictions are in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space restrictions .
&quot; the card @-@ card groups informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works similarly . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO System , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to bo@@ oting the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
