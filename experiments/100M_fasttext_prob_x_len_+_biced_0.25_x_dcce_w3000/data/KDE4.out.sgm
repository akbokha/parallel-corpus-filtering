<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & conqueror; provides another view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; is to graphically present nested folders with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportionally to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"at & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. accordingly, large files can be detected even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of & UNIX; command you are considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView; is an entry in the tread representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful colour and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either display depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordinate right angles is to be used (whereby, consequently, rendering errors may occur due to restrictions in the character of the treble). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of performance algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the surface of an entry is done for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. here, it is useful for the labelling and avoidance of space losses through frames that rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive divisions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimal area for an entry via the menu item view. instead, a room pattern is drawn into the area of the higher order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users.</seg>
<seg id="60">"this opens a dialogue with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system."</seg>
<seg id="61">"& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that means users and developers help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to answer you questions about other users from & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipack; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">"the best start to get to & digikam, is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for notifying in the developer mailing list of & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="64">"for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name, or click the folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the databnk is stored. this path will remain the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you want."</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as base folders. no image will be changed. while searching the folder, you will see a progress indicator like this:"</seg>

<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo taken from the album and this will be used as an album symbol. more details can be found in the section albums."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help RohkameraSupport menu."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. of course, every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as disk drive. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"& digikam; uses the gphoto2 program to communicate with Digitalkameras. gphoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras. it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gphoto2."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digikam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how easy it can expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules with all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digious; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in & digikam; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"moving and storing images functions everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbaums, via the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name works only if this ind of the symbol view is also displayed. which fields are displayed, you can configure the dialog of the settings."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos taken by & digikam, are stored in a single nightstand. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk. the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu, you will have to choose whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move it to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album Collections: are a method to mark your albums, so that you can be grouped by a common name. the collection from you will be used to sorting your photos. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections."</seg>

<seg id="151">"you may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same location. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures on different subjects and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>

<seg id="296">"with Chroma-subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminous density than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation."</seg>
<seg id="297">"with setting PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, since PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression."</seg>
<seg id="298">"with the option TIFF compressed, you can switch the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF photos. this reduces the size of the TIFF photos. it does not affect the image quality, because the DEFLATE algorithm works lossless."</seg>
<seg id="299">"with the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy mode, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG."</seg>

<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">"this setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is a solid color balance, which is photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight."</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the default is the top lights, so the parts of your images are burned to look at the lights, because of the inability of your camera to capture the top lights. finally, use the setting of continuous white in the settings. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you choose to reconstruct the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted for each image individually."</seg>
<seg id="308">"set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digious; to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively."</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the particles that have many cameras and which makes a matrix color-coloured pixel available. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>

<seg id="318">"there are other options like the Soft Proof Profile, which you can emulate as your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print a picture because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that have actually photographed or scanned colors come from your camera or scanner. with a color-controlled workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing workflows."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color administration."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"if so, if sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another color space and then have to think about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe shaped region, and colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click Info and then click information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you're working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor, because sRGB is selected. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve one image in most cases. therefore use it before you attempt a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, balance, Automatic Abuse and Contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction try automatically out of your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values over the entire picture so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing his shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method calculates the brightness of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity canal is as flat as possible. this makes the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete Histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhancement: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a rejification of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because you are working on a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry Color White Balance of the Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the destination image can be seen. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"the histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminancy."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or download the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons stored as and loading make exactly this. every setting of the white balance that you have set, you can save it in a text file and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the preset button presets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings can result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as those used for processing crude images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness settings. a detailed manual for using color profiles can be consulted from chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under colors of tonality correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, allowing you to use several color channels at the same time. this is useful if your camera or scanner will always need the same error and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digious; tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"the coloured, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negatives of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar isation effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -Effect. it differs from saturation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a reversed color film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color levels of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminance / contrast / gamma, the tool is located toning correction to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you will need only the area of the slider for the application purpose. more concrete the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph, three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">"the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controls, and pay attention to how the image changes."</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be adjusted whether the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis is displayed. in pictures the large areas of a constant color involve the linear histogram of a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones, often called gammaxes."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinpoints can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a light image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted to all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left side, half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview is updated dynamically based on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that have been captured using a digital camera, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a short part to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixel darker are darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can make exactly this. any curve that you have created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"when you create this method and the three color pipette buttons, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photograph that was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digious; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shade of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">"with the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview."</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the destination image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"the controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness even if you are using the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you also want to reduce the respective color components. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible roar that comes from the color-space. color-row consists of small room artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colorbox first."</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as well as store buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer settings can save you later and load it. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the option Luminancy is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">"black / white photography has always been fascinating about your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step step, as color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles."</seg>

<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moon light scenes at daytime. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color toning correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">This is very similar to the process of leaching a pressure and re-development in a sepia oner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digious; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">"adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this."</seg>

<seg id="470">The menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">"for the stencil, there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digious; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org"</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produced especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitalization process colours with only minimal differences to a colour point. this, in turn, results in sharp edges closer to a common colour. SLR cameras normally require sharpening as normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often used to have internal sharpening. images in rough format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners are already using a depth of field while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool. this allows you to call sharpening with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"they should be careful with this, as the results do not seem very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most suitable technique to sharpen one image refocus the tool. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it can be sharpened. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry Corrigate soft draw and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the mixed image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use of difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpening and hence beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example for the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfission-Filter -algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurry mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular circuit works much better than the Gauß 'sche folding. the Gauß' folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixelae that are far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse der Gauß 'folding is actually very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. the resulting undesirable results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular circuit. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artefacts. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are very rare. however, values higher than 0.1 are very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will still further contaminate the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"palate sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter when your Unity Gauß is' sch '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformations matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The storage as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter that you have set is stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, which later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you are reading pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, blurred masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter. the FIR Wiener filter is often better when processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothing the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink tints allow a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"Detailerrestraint p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. weighting larger values mainly makes homogeneous regions smooth and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening should always be necessary."</seg>
<seg id="520">"motion dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specify how often the algorithm is passed. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle measuring range da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the More about quality that you receive by selecting this option is low. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to allow it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons storage as and loading make exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors have been removed with minor artefacts. the module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">"die & digikam, noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce draulic noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert."</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"the following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain with default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to detect luminescent changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the picture. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the picture. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamemulation of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically are more distorted, but also contaminates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, can remove noise and phase jitter on the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool for soft sign with the menu entry Corrigate soft drawing and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts of your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß 'ash noise, film grading, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or retroactive digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture reproduction. the texture composition is carried out with another tool, the image error correction, and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a low-loss compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactor quot; - small standards that are to be seen in uncompressed Picture."</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons storage as and loading make exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with uniformity noise is reduced.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera was captured on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scannerlight and photopaper. the original image is shown under (1) and the corrected image is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">"the & digious; tool Hotpixel allows hot pixels of photos with a CCD camera gem, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp."</seg>
<seg id="554">"bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality rough-quality photos as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built-in suppression for hot pixels."</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button darkview. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important to capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark image to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the darker will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will load it again in the next session."</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help to correct the result within the picture. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all thumbnail areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">"averages: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixel in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="565">"below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"the & digious; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo formats, can often not light the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 for the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise lack effects can be caused by motion."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's film and color grads and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation on a rough image that is done without this filter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker's copyright."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the Vignetting Correction filter and with three more exposure to the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the grade of light reinforcement at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is an optical filter with aperture adjustment of 1, or randomly a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting Correction decreases the brightness of pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only have to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a fine adjustment of exposure to the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digious; image processing from the menu color gradation."</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminance correction and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">Die & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the coefficient of the fourth grade corrects the removed corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion 4th grade. this value is stronger than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners' has the reversed sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value returns the image size and thereby corrects the first degree of gravity. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">"bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filtering settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as default values."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the Tonn- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line. move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them using the trimming tool in the menu Transforming trimming from image processing or via the Zoom controller of this dialogue."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motives, such as photos from the front, frames and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>

<seg id="607">"the filter engraver is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monstroy landscape."</seg>

<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the sharpness a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unity: blurred the image by turning the pixels at a point. this simulates the Unity of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: wipe the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"motion blurred: wipe the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographic camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"softening Unity: blurs the image softly into the dark and strongly in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Shooter: wipe the picture by random shifting of pixels and thus simulates the Unity of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart Unity: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>

<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your images a nice look. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size is not automatically growing with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can choose with the & digious; image editing an area free of raindrops. use the tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter rain drops, the area will remain free of rain drops."</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo blown is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transforming size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialogue is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating."</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation e.g. Spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the buttons stored as and loading are used exactly for this purpose. every single extension for photo can be enlarged as a text file, and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo inflates is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button."</seg>
<seg id="639">The original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">"trimming a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to cut a photo you simply have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the rectangle size by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"in the dialog box, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the selected relationship and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored in the EXIF spreadsheets so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the integration assistance allow you to hide help, so that you can better put your pictures together. these help are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-elregel, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden middle: the golden middle is a division of different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of its two preceding numbers."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more liquid relief lines when you put an image together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-party rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow on this type."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral mentioned above. their vertex points are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect of dynamic symmetry called by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the relief lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it is easy to keep the camera upright or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the free rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. once you have moved it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after turning a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function transformer trimming from image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic trimming. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you have to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new Width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through the transformation, in pixels."</seg>

<seg id="673">Angle right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to bersome it is to cut the image with transformer trimming out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the scaling tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is not rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforming scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">"you can switch horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane."</seg>

<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">"the conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quality of it is: expect from dcraw not to produce the same results, as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!"</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">"the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switches have no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"the Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or further use it elsewhere, you should not select the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start converting button to start converting. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are secure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the options available are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if they have been created in an earlier attempt. however, the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>

<seg id="881">"after selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and the mail is attached."</seg>
<seg id="882">"the PNG format under the File Format File format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to low-loss formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format."</seg>
<seg id="883">"if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent."</seg>

<seg id="887">The filename option displays that the filename of the images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">"between the images, the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect."</seg>

<seg id="921">"lastly, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. so you can avoid that information is displayed, which are obvious to the viewer even without description. for example, you can't use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page, you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, do not download images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get an image larger, he changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"best choose a base folder for all your HTML files, and for each subsequent set a new subfolder."</seg>

<seg id="928">"after you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created, this folder should be. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them to it. so the import function, see, properly works, you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings that are just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create your pictures with these. you can of course create a HTML page for viewing the pictures."</seg>

<seg id="935">"an external .kim file searches the images in a double way. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file directory. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images can be viewed, which you can access via the File Export..."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>

<seg id="940">"kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the images in full size, because the .kim file would be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example can be seen on the image.</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called Aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adaptive-recursively; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is continually subdivided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that can be followed individually and on further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the record can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called jittering. if you switch jittering, change & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which computes diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch-tt must be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a rifle for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a rifle. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of whatever sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, where each sound represents another percussioner instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc.) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of ever the same drum (as some keyboards possess)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to depict sounds on the percussion channel. take a look at the keymaps provided.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to train some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>

<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender Event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that will play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button glows no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices at very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2056">"backup to the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most popular extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; Repository check if someone has already done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE config file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html 11.2 = tag1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag3 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example you can now see in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,...

<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that sub-folders are in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequent at the top end of the tree view and mdash; folders are displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, if writing a & PHP; -scripts would display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of shared context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"now, you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there."</seg>

<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different locations, you can send a menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, send the toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useless for publishing. to make a contribution to the source of resources, we recommend the source of resources, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can be empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), the toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, still before installation, investigates & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is unsigned, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tagXML format."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to draw full benefits from & quantaplus; this chapter attempts to familiarize them with these fundamental concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. from toolbars over actions, everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then can be available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local items represent a personal collection of Web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local items are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which allows the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the building manners, the flashcards with information and the toolbars. please note, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the cartridge with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, like closing the current, other or all flashbacks, recharge, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editor area lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), help the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file, if the string under the mouse pointer is called a file."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; then click on the icon that represents the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. now, you can fill the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog various fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the building manners (QIT;) enable you to navigate and navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and streak them. in the representation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"a further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the breakdown in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking a element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it you can change attributes and namespaces quickly. the content-oriented inlet system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packaged documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed."</seg>

<seg id="2207">"you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files view of a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and backup. by default, it can be stored in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template."</seg>
<seg id="2208">"project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can pre-enter headlines and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow template is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"to specify the behavior of a folder, click the right mouse button on the folder and select properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:"</seg>

<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor in a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the Vohandbt of & PHP; -Source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>

<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time changed the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merged."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later any amount of further useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window."</seg>

<seg id="2622">"to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" speech dispatcher "works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the continued orders will be resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the output of the warning.</seg>

<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. every order that you initiate from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text applications are meant for the output of longer texts, which do not have any particular urgency."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such template reads, this issue is stopped and terminated."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"strings replacing parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the formalization of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form."</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. included are some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"with voice selection filters, you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the flashcard speaker, you can read text by KDE messages about it."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is used for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules are not true, the text remains unchanged at the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"when a text order, message, warning or a & kde; - Notification on & ktts; sent, it is edited by all activated filters that were set up on the page. editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2903">"before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be saved.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">"as a result, a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created. you can set the following settings for a safety profile:"</seg>

<seg id="2935">"if a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only record a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar files that can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system restores the various protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that may be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first try to open the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol - this is not shown, and it opens itself instead of the system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no authorization to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion, or after entered strings."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"of course, you can also select another entry on this page. for example, the string of the filter search term is only available with entries in the corresponding column."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the stage errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of the stage indication. the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off input dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (for example in system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can skip the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new incoming protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log on the menu in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find further information about the sources of reference from & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and named as named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system quickly develops to the standard for the control of program start when driving the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know anything about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without a reinstallation and reformat. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead directly in / etc. this folder is named rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you would like to start when moving the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"the rc.local should be located in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches at different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the starting field:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you restart the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually launch these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when it contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that runs only httpd, & sendmail;, Network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere. this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sortiser number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore items thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tab key to activate the different workspaces (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; to run under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated if their configuration files are not present or wrongly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel to be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>

<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you will need to save them. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or save it in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double-click on the entry. the dialog appears user and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some map cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes."</seg>
