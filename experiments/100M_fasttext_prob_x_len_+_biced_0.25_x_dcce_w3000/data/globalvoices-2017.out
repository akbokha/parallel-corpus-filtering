&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this land had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a law student who was willing to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very warmer love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he trans@@ forms with his narrow @-@ face .
&quot; in his opinion , he never holds behind the mountain , as you say so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican presidential elections , was the highest number one of the nom@@ inees nominated by the Party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ y person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s world@@ view did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; in the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life long the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
it still fits to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment that always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump got his way to the nominated repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or maybe because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , one of my friends said , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most of whom are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( N.@@ B. ) : &quot; &quot; den@@ ying the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; pu@@ n from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which meant so much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as the great Van Jones called , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a vast majority of the white America &apos;s promise and says , &quot; Hell with diversity , freedom of religion , and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot destroy their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music , which is played at both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now the La b@@ anda de m@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them . &quot;
a musical school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for their drug abuse and the gangs of gangs . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically above on the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with restored instruments made of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the rub@@ b@@ ish The children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about a billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - as the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this kind at their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobil@@ ised themselves against the ship . they refused to run one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , due to the pill@@ age of fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; apart from Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that were exp@@ elled from their bodies at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like minded and work together . they exchange information and interact with each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas , such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such tests can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were travelling and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al region . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay sentences as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a advis@@ er who advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing companies , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of fan@@ ta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past a ship could be caught illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ ecting suspic@@ ious ships more precisely . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to trace the illegal ships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to conc@@ eal their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , a NGO dedicated to fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be controlled by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that combines different levels of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of every single trac@@ e@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust@@ s has a similar project in which a global system permits the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them off . &quot;
&quot; ships that were exploited without licence earlier , and hardly expected to expect consequences , now know they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses since then . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped det@@ ecting Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions is said , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first great triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the behaviour of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans is actually functioning throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . &quot;

street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the resolution of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government &apos;s government rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into void by gathering on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the rep@@ atri@@ ation of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among others in the region of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the country of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition have the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end , the reluc@@ tance to re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was considered , the referendum was considered to be the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , the prot@@ esters called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday national civil strike , and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;
next : pic@@ .@@ t@@ witter@@ .com / 9@@ Zy@@ V@@ Gl@@ d@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches , published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also fights with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; this Vene@@ tians cry out . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images , which tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
especially big waves hit the news on police repression in the central north @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the government &apos;s own statement prior to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear coats because you could otherwise see something that many national guards do not have !
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the scale of suppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
&quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office , which was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets . &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs for this :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your res@@ ignation !
on the street !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has undertaken little against the devastating economic crisis , and would prefer to c@@ log critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are growing more and more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , who was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qu@@ ij@@ ano said in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting from the office , carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation then I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
&quot; as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t realize then that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano .
archi@@ val .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder of almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and he testi@@ fied of a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child has chosen a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass just that she will not kidn@@ ap you som@@ ed@@ ay and I will save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because so my father had educated me . &quot;
on the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There are prisoners being tort@@ ured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack in which cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - were simply everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small packing wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were put off and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a couch that people were tort@@ ured .
it looked like a bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that it was attached to that one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just enc@@ ir@@ cled there .
&quot; they rarely associate a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horrible ... like a dirty win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that it is the smell of a body in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bound to the eye . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down@@ ward - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people sat still on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were thrown into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers . &quot;
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man there and killed a man .
&quot; according to survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was indic@@ ted by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
&quot; when you look on the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tort@@ ured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from the top came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Cri@@ mean &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war crimes are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military badges , which you have fought against an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war crime but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
&quot; for that , we need no one else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I have no single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense , a conspir@@ ator accused me of this crime . I answered , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the dead is the last disgu@@ sting act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have been exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself again and again : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were cr@@ ammed and disp@@ elled somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought of showing my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt internally displaced and asked me why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like this ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
he just said &quot; Na then show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I ref@@ unded the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally have said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended sentences of life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ ires . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 accused died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ for@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ war@@ State terrorism &quot;
&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have been working on justice for the victims for years .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was , so that there could be a memorial , which is now directed by human rights organizations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto where you can pro@@ long your driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Kyoto city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , witnessed a particularly mis@@ fu@@ elled translation last month . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word was carried out by the Japanese word ( kor@@ ean @-@ sha ) , which means &quot; older motor@@ ists , &quot; wrong@@ ly - perhaps also with malicious thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible motor@@ ists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1st to 20th September .
&quot; adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was made to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , which is appearing in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; &quot; bad drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ mati@@ cal not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) were replaced . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country , however , is quite an occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; as a result , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the repor@@ ter , named above , brought comments to the light published on Yahoo in the article published on Yahoo , which show the prejudi@@ ces of some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; among other things , the article on Yahoo with the translation error was provided by the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre error in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and pro@@ active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who have no foreign employees , can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions , which are produced by mechanical translations , show that this technique cannot replace any human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies especially to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints , which often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7th , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay &apos;s online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet sites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
other online transm@@ itters over@@ took photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that re@@ fut@@ ed the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closing arguments if they continue to report on the demonstrations as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ filter confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses the request for calling such a website . &quot;

&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ sponsored channel , was suspended on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was defeated while he was in custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report by Kur@@ tural that is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; just before her gradu@@ ation from the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , people in Paraguay are the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes her min@@ der@@ born son or her inferior daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice , referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , as the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ tic is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , on the one hand , the family who is their daughter in the faith that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with her and justi@@ fies his exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it for many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed ves@@ tiges of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra defeated a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply responsible for the death of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozens of people came together to protest protests and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ setting - if the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mer , in which her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was ready with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get food in@@ definitely . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was forced to stand beside him and read editorial articles such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he held it intellig@@ ently , but did not stay with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn poor habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak their mother tongue again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken , are bul@@ lying and the chic@@ anes to which Cri@@ adi@@ ans are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .

the Company appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for clean@@ ers and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrator of the group is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
Hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to you .
beginning from Monday when possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town of Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ eventh girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year history . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad spl@@ itted once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the wives of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ and the native inhabitants of Paraguay . therefore , it is not justi@@ fiable that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted for a bill &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up in order to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adop@@ ting the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill consisting of six parag@@ rap@@ hs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video content and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should make the registration . un@@ clear is the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill of law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , blocking Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of this , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; executive researcher &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they have for@@ ci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who seek permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to supply them to a court process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in accordance with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Parliament of Parliament Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those intended to be found guilty of threatening the &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

the shelter H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which w@@ anders through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous animal in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see an Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore determines that they have a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as an educated bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to passion@@ ately reveal a different side of her country , which is not just about war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a fruitful pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to leave , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost whole coastal towns from the map . &quot;
&quot; even to this end , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , that &apos;s why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of the local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese recovery agency and survey results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spar@@ row houses ( history of the town ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u , were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i achieved the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary accommodation has been made to reloc@@ ate to final spare houses , even six years after the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 more than 30,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who were hau@@ led after the disaster in homes were settled into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o magazine was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have grown gener@@ ously in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land . &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it seems more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ acu@@ ees . &quot;
in their introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ consciousness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in their edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper increased its attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were settled into permanent replacement homes . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 stand , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , still in temporary shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . it is known because efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one realis@@ es that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we cover topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
&quot; on@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike sur@@ rendered their aff@@ ection to the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana Mac@@ ias talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was put into the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer took him over against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied Social Sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police reported in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the incident . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officer , as he beats in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary blocks shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;

intelligence : semi@@ - ( 2 @-@ 4 )
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only country in Brazil where there was a brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
&quot; polic@@ emen were in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mig@@ u@@ osse and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the dep@@ u@@ ties Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media has sli@@ pped off street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo informed about a broken glass window to illustrate their cover pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus put on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic cause , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence in the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de@@ fle@@ ction of Cuba in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the death , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls the fact that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; a few decades ago , the message would have been a motive for concern for the country , but bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural prospects &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the 2001 level ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , got their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially included documents , which would be differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all of them were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters were becoming more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ off factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in whose construction he helped .
&quot; with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work producer was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services that generated the facilities in the municipalities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked at the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather than they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ es other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without a view of the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine crops bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month , in order to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use hip hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with themes that are important for them . they do they through hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshops are bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the ped@@ ago@@ gue David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop assumes that the young participants in discussions include topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ service dance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where you@@ ths are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West kan@@ ada , where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
&quot; for the most part , the cases were not elu@@ ci@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ star hip @-@ hop group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos; we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one ever would be interested in me
but I try to keep my days on earth
that is the day you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and proceed as well as our youth . &quot;
&quot; thus , they can do what they intended for the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ents of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ands ( which is also published on his blog and re@@ published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( in general , in general ) , outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of every dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see themselves these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ dic district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is now transformed into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new mobile rib@@ b@@ ons decorated with plastic , as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin &apos;s refrigerator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences becomes increasingly complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we have also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , ic@@ ura or laugh@@ ing is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our new mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # 5 , in the event of the h@@ ash@@ tag # 4.6 in the case of # Custom@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi that dedic@@ ates itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . as for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missed and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these mirrors not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never cure . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) , which is said to give this sacrifice a voice and tell stories of people who came into struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ icking and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; fear lives &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , lost her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked ourselves to go and to find graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on 15 October he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid off because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for a few years now .
&quot; I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with images , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for criminals or from acts of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different and consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , as if they were sin@@ king those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them too . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified to be &quot; &quot; inc@@ ess@@ ant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main town district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this , she describes how armed criminal month paid money from her business until it destroyed not only the business , but also tore her family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life completely in just a few days .
&quot; the pain about it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , fear comes back again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by force . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , tor@@ tillas and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father saw , which had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Council for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosecutor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades . &quot;
if one image is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to manipul@@ ating trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for many years and devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank truck fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses covered including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people who watched the football World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of sal@@ ted bodies , which are str@@ ung along the floor while people look at them . &quot;
but here history does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been resear@@ ched several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said an inhabit@@ ant of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up period could be visually displayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ allocation ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , the image was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
another step further brings personal comments like this example wrong@@ ly the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to providing arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following were posted , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from a Saudi @-@ Arab news site , which happened in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said that mon@@ k and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to image this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein Being this statement , but did not have the image associated with the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false data
traces of these false cou@@ plings go back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot;
&quot; a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixing mas@@ ch of private sites , platforms of social media and Community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , others tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have defined examples of the ab@@ usive use and associated them with the respective countries , based on which side they have been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below , several examples may be used for ab@@ usive use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be fully r@@ acked ( on the orange card ) :

the orange @-@ coloured countries are still available on pages or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; the gray countries are examples that are available according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ fei@@ ting examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students en@@ rolled by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital news site , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was in circulation later in connection with the 2015 massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo , signed with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , which occurred presum@@ ably in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ eted ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message supposedly written by a &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) Tin@@ eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and are the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equal to the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zed and have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media help others to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss with for@@ ci@@ ble representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used as a part of the context or completely ab@@ usive species . &quot;
&quot; however , every examination of false write @-@ downs should also take into account how internationally they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog un@@ v@@ eils the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog named Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bri@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the V@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Mus@@ h@@ room for your parents in recognition of how to have tried yourself in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The ease or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they de@@ pl@@ ore other cultures , reveal other thoughts of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable words &quot; &quot; and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favor@@ ites here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka wor@@ sens with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country via the banks . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka on May 28 , 2017 126 people were killed and scar@@ cely hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; rain falls on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly returned . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds are wor@@ sen@@ ing the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ ern crisis , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are ready to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants that are floo@@ ded in their floo@@ ded villages .
several organizations and startups have also decided to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provides important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ag@@ us will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free of charge to the Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; key , which resulted in more than 1,000 en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and contribute assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next elections , we are heading up rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ inea slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; who built themselves in their imagination . &quot;
they de@@ mus@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like I don &apos;t fit there , will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
to be de@@ mus@@ cled
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
&quot; this is even to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images come to mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western performance religion Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ ak them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feed . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades have led to nine Muslim women their countries , while the USA did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and Saudi , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought to slavery by slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and flaw@@ ed our collective imagination that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and chic@@ an@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion owned
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population are African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan had re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ wit@@ ted Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now unavoid@@ able Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - rather than picking up my Muslim recipes or picking up my handy bag of hand@@ bags that all Muslims carry with them - &quot; &quot; of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ oked , we don &apos;t carry all the ash@@ tra@@ ys with us . &quot;
we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with financi@@ ers , think tanks and experts for false information that our already flaw@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a foreig@@ ner who breaks down the head@@ scarf . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , Behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour are not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the br@@ anding would see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms and whis@@ per@@ ing the Arab verses to the shelter , which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; how to win a competition of the art of arran@@ ger in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see at that moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Mus@@ lim@@ a means speaking the prayers they told me to speak when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Mus@@ lim@@ a is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - was col@@ oni@@ alized by a &quot; Empire &quot; which a company founded by the name of Hon@@ orable British East In@@ corporation , it has a deep meaning to mention God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow up and hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan cri@@ es to his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been colon@@ ized all the way to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fly @-@ bomb of history was disc@@ ar@@ ded over a century ago over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , mir@@ acul@@ ous sub @-@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he was the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , go deep into our memorable family trees ; our un@@ experienced history . &quot;
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over each continent , apart from Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is pun@@ ishing the US and bears the suspect a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build up structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ sters , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; , &quot; which largely refers to Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
it is the wars we are leading and the bombs that we disc@@ ard on Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically rig@@ orous picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints we are doing in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to prolifer@@ ate Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we find ourselves .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , are now leading the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; other . &quot;
another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
a few years earlier it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but that made me an ir@@ resist@@ able Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , a story may be loud , where someone is being made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the Berkeley bridge , conversations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I talking about this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people through the work of the &quot; others &quot; have been included in the public presentation four decades ago himself scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously rep@@ j@@ ure the &quot; others &quot; because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake feeds while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other &quot; made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Corporate Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported a different initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ matched blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and honour the linguistic diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk of small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , accept diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often linked to understanding , these events instead &quot; listening to appreciate , feel , to make . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and representation are leading to the fact that the audience is involved in it . &quot;
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of the Has@@ en and the P@@ avian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative performances . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States re @-@ forti@@ fication of sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which was over 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ ning Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
she was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ organization of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico demanded that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be reconc@@ iled with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the territory of an integrated territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; for this reason , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation focuses on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers appreciate the work of the missing Syrian developer Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for more than a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open grid . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is available roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is said : &quot;
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with this .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feed and to create some sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory section of his book , entitled Collec@@ tive Memory , gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what did we give up in this process of temporarily extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , b@@ ass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; were on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that it was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
but its where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passes the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded b@@ asset , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ ka &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ vision@@ ary than the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civi@@ liz@@ ations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would expose everything to this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , b@@ ass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace them . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; b@@ ass@@ el taught me English , even when he was det@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
b@@ ass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ clamation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was det@@ ained . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose sight in the moment in which we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that every one of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I am going into every detail of your voice and words
which I wear with my passion
when your eyes are f@@ arewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
to bring back all the moments
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
during the month
&quot; I in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ ka &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tort@@ ured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of b@@ asset since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release on previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants on account of contamination of 54 million Me@@ tic@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public money from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was prec@@ eded by Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to his old post , as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many people don &apos;t like the action well . &quot;
&quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle . &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary approach against the contrary .
&quot; however , the company seems to be silent and does not indu@@ ce appropriate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and of which half had to eat . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to become re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director lacks any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks morality to return and to serve the state , but has had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was when he affir@@ med that &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not that way . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years off and came free . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der veins .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although there is still discussion about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or , as part of an initiative , to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely de@@ preci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hatred in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call for hate speech . &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use .
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was extingu@@ ished today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ alls is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before spreading all posts which are suspected of being racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm is not understood what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead is carefully analyzing the post , checking it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ tine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; ( spi@@ der b@@ ins ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , spreading the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative writing of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to copy , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; failed to meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post has been removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a huge turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks auto cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which have no hate speech but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out if Facebook removes the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should in addition hei@@ ghten violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of refugees to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure , the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ Per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as defined , &quot; every person under 18 years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , trying to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated issue , and at some point there was no doubt whether the opposition would agree with the draft law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and pro@@ claim the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which has once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and none of them decided against it . &quot;
&quot; after he was previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws were finally changed for children &apos;s marriage .
&quot; Lov@@ ell Francis , who cloth@@ ed a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk , which has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the mar@@ ital age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft on the amend@@ ment of the spouse has been decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all parliam@@ ent@@ arians who were contrary to the law have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth shield .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announces his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to have made his promise now . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; rather sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that can only indu@@ ce panic and dis@@ grace if we , rather than talking about the problem that the state , our daughters guard against them , would be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ faced men that are compared to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

the h@@ ackers posted the YouTube video &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; the Office of the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office calls on citizens not to follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events !
&quot; at 11.15 the message was removed from the site - however , it remained intact in the cache . &quot;
it has disappeared .
&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosecutor told the local news service Yar@@ News that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , opposed to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , dark@@ ened internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share reliable and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many online users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain closed , several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform depos@@ ited all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is available in spite of legal ban . &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to lay snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors if the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
one attacks another URL that is not the original . that which you can see is by Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a Su@@ hl@@ ende N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera in himself and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar has tried to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first class situation helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately started to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar is striving for a cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature , and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so terri@@ fying as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he was already standing by face to face toward him , saying , &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bug appeared . he immediately goes , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for promoting Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , that live near the tourist information . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ mp@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India it avo@@ ids women with greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; instead , they use pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should abuse the norm to preserve this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and viol@@ ated by her family and community after she had addressed a married relationship with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives is also not to be called by the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less fear to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , compet@@ ed in a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the refin@@ ement of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ware works for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and manages these clubs . &quot;
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , was women who did not call her hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
&quot; not to speak out loud in the name of her hus@@ bands , is a custom that she is all guilty and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not conc@@ eal this , is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf up to now , wanted to try out at home as it was going . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent long after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him on his name from now on . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this confidence in luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does it mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the crus@@ hing of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , she was only cau@@ tious about him ; another decided to release the whole stroke of fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
and they held their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the tine @-@ red dot on the forehead , which indicates the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ thy point if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not ceased completely , but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who what to hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since her marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ted cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own fashion choice , morality linked with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the wheels : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have only made small steps . &quot;
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped telling the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ ag@@ gle for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club goes home and other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29 June of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les in 1964 , re@@ marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
it became clear to people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka told , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . about 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese Central schools . &quot;
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survived everything .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Winn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John L@@ enn@@ on should represent or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sk@@ ur@@ ril enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base as a market technology , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?

&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;
&quot; following the h@@ ash@@ tag , the formation of the &quot; &quot; Beat@@ les Mem@@ ories &quot; &quot; continues to experience more information about the Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;
gl@@ itter @-@ headed men are deport@@ ed and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald @-@ headed men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .
&quot; photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald @-@ headed persons for the organ@@ elles , probably for super@@ ficial purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ let , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
&quot; two men were arrested , and in the wake they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used . &quot;
&quot; according to the local super@@ sti@@ tions , that the head of a man @-@ headed man could bring gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC announced . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ itter @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 in the South African country a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique travel bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the mos@@ aic police following the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police said the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims were in their head power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a who suggested that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I like to be ashamed of E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH Sh@@ ame A Land in which people would have shame to go to the streets , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ ficial purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; will be hun@@ ted , which aim to achieve rapid riches . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not escape the opportunity for spot@@ less hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , and the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed : &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt sympathy towards his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding the public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in Arab Blog@@ ger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ ka &apos;s wife , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that she was contacted by persons who spend themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; Bash@@ ar &apos;s stay and constitution remained unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials knew he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we show all the creativity of Bass@@ el as a pioneer in the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have committed themselves in the last five years for his release .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , thus the organization Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
countless of those arrested by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , such as the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man said he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to leave or treat him abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government ha@@ sten@@ ed that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to re @-@ record the salmon exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ ats of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she said in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA ( USA )
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , so that he could help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person in the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US Embassy drew an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following to the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of access and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany ( Germany )
&quot; German government spokes@@ person Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u receives all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns if the host could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada ( in english )
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says on :
&quot; in Canada , China calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France ( Germany )
&quot; in a statement on June 29 , France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France would eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan &#124; Taiwan
&quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and announced that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been strictly punished , had led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter signed by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
it supports Singapore to be regarded as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian cre@@ ators who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system . &quot;
he refused appropriate questions with non @-@ answers rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our cheap K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clear this point , as long as it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ easy , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; Singapore is no country , &quot; &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment on Shan@@ mu@@ gam as a leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Singapore minister of Justice said , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but this is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review dis@@ covers the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , &quot; &quot; sinned a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally country and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role in the cabinet of government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who does our prime minister need to pay back ?
what is the value of our rosa identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to affir@@ m , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ? &quot;
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , which reveals rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and to show another fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook internally with anger if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves to their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we apparently say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be di@@ ligent - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing on which one can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if one wants to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a leading part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than &apos; nice &apos; . our Prime Minister made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop @-@ band in Thailand released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed , which took power in 2014 , and despite their promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to rule . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band tat@@ too Colour describes a young man , who tells the rules he makes his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band has been praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 254 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the He@@ aler absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; setting change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unity in the army was also set up , the online content supervis@@ es and persons who are accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict regime against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was declared in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta still pursu@@ es is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long imprisonment , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs became members of the band , who im@@ itated the sal@@ ute of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the cl@@ ergy @-@ cities in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the Soviet Union . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and the Ab@@ ys@@ ers live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called cl@@ ergy @-@ cities in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cl@@ ergy @-@ cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely having climbed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are tr@@ apped and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

&quot; at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man . &quot;
he starts a conversation and it is hard to stop this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 2 ) 1,@@ 50@@ 6 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty residents live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ow@@ kas , which houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately go back . &quot;
&quot; our mother for@@ b@@ ade us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

Gal@@ ina does not want to accept any financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do so constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; calls aun@@ t G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A to her . &quot; &quot; they said we could grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village of the village before the war .

Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s nursery was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;

but over time they lost their anxiety .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs over to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; as they run , some of them throw stones on the abandoned buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for immort@@ ality in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the time it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also have slept outside on boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication they cannot pay , she mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a pe@@ ach be@@ ard ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages , when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ ery outside . &quot;
Valencia declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a solo traveler , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go to the next steps . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays , the trav@@ eller consul@@ ts quietly their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she bl@@ ends in her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots , which she has made an artist , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sad while she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; Ya @-@ fu@@ eron , &quot; repeat it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , the &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are compelled to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone user in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it as@@ signs the District Government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than just fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web sites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on users &apos; experience in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , afflic@@ ted ethnic minorities like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme assur@@ ances and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ inely internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet , based on Twitter , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest of the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; &quot; China &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , resulting from the fact that the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and therefore receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang might be a reaction to the instructions of the City party council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , a US human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible transgres@@ sions , including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and notice that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes its name all honor .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality comes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of disaster . you will see that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security minister formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough that the city sh@@ ook the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all the districts cov@@ eted , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , rain , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had a little cal@@ med down , after the power supply ceased to work in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke through the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I listened to my voice through the silence .
few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a glorious picture , filled with my expectations and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed the whole way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry , if we are not near . &quot;
his hate @-@ filled eyes focused on me .
&quot; and you don &apos;t trust what to look into your eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father immediately . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed to months . &quot;
I cried the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; afterwards , through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ ede all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have allocated to me a larger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and must immediately set me without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I got back to an old tried @-@ and @-@ tried communication method : to beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ rade was a &quot; &quot; ear@@ nest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man middle @-@ aged , who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness no markings can be detected by me , and doctors are not there ; we are all numbers only . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden . &quot;
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear her crying &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security from us and to prevent the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational pres@@ tige and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , here is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I supervised the audi@@ torium and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ive him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to protest you this day , and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to this punishment , although I did not do anything to make this punishment . &quot;
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hang@@ man is i@@ dol to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t fall enough to him , why they exchanged the tube with a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined together to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them differ@@ ed from them while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find any pleasure in it , which is why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged stick . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed all my body , enough to supply all my quarters . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect current leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible worries . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and go away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he nar@@ rows to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes even to his couch . &quot;
but what one can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips to discover with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s family fled to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questions its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through borders , and he can feel the dis@@ astro@@ us consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he turns against the US foreign policy a special reluc@@ tance . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even when he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sol@@ ves Nes@@ cafÃ© in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan , and in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot young couple has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the sl@@ ings speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sha@@ vers of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when looking into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert statement . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the dep@@ u@@ ties and former press spokes@@ persons in the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la valued the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to stand for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simply sei@@ z@@ ure rhetor@@ ic , but actually reflected in Jordan &apos;s clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality , which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b returned to Lei@@ be &apos;s traditional sex men by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently un@@ married woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &quot; honor mur@@ ders &quot; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to the Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure is still lacking in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species . &quot;
&quot; according to a law bann@@ ing crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ famili@@ al violence must be det@@ ained at in@@ definite time in prison , and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary that the woman will not happen . &quot;
&quot; even H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music is very popular , and is known to shy away from issues that are long considered tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I became a politi@@ cian , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b calls on the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of the songs that are political at the heart can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words , &quot; &quot; that can get what you want &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of homosexu@@ als and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were heavily cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to mem@@ ori@@ ze his comments from the context , twi@@ sted , and cens@@ ored his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but was only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service held several former government officials and members of the teaching alliance , argu@@ ing that they had critically vo@@ iced concerns on comments in social media , which coinci@@ ded with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will bring about real and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not through bombs , disper@@ sions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced democr@@ acies . at least , it hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to z@@ ap and therefore also resist resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man belongs to the Student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many parts of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing were deployed over more than one thousand years to force the indigenous people of the region , the Emis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of the capital of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street smoke and illegal drug traff@@ icking are everyday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru experiences as many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of poor advice to obtain an education in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the opportunities presented have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
&quot; before the school year starting in March , the school offered special educational workshops and reported some of their achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question was precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa warfare F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in International , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; but before the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to a war rhetor@@ ic and carried out their arms round the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who will then be personally handed over .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgent attention . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ art Foundation entered the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set up the way they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of shelter from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former milit@@ ant led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bus@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do you do right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected something else from life as war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injustice has appeared on the part of the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never found hearing and had no right to vote , and to recognize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful emotions were very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men , too , who have killed and so much damage done , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have replied to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans have been prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and his first publication on the website OC Media took place .
&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the past few months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ worth over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports published that addressed the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ former , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the United States last week . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ former stuck in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything and started crying .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which sick@@ nesses have you been placed - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated and my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they asked me absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going up@@ stairs without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have a cup size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she took a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later I was standing under the window a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my Human Rights Friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without registration , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you were in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person to look out of her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have been d@@ ord@@ ant ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who fed into ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; with this , I mean , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons det@@ ained ?
Sab@@ rina : an acquain@@ tance of me says that there were not very many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to make Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their be@@ ard grew .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there were no reports until now . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in quite Great Britain when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to lead us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had coloured eyel@@ ashes and wore tube jeans and short tops .
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria never has curved me a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ots are not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of sick people .
&quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes closed before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was constantly wor@@ sen@@ ing . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ff , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I do not spend a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ab@@ dic@@ ated influ@@ enza .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; this is the nature , which has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam before the mouth , that there are no ow@@ ls at them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist , but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s uncomfortable to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - prac@@ tising Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know many think about transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a trust@@ worth@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things , two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not so sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th led the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he ple@@ aded for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to raise the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video made on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ rad hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ators were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all family patri@@ cians , who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of pursuing their families because of persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of pursuing their families . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community lives in Iran , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and in 1925 made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has refused to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of tribes , the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught caused by dro@@ ught , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , said Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process is a combination of a high number of new ethnic groups and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination . &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activ@@ ist activ@@ ates alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex continues through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black female women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used by racial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya &apos; to sing my Lord &apos; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
&quot; but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we face black women in two @-@ fold manner . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women to have equal rights to all men and all men at all ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in her thinking , which refers to both the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women and again and again .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical terms is a mere and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to anim@@ ate them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and limit themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join me of the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly is that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana perhaps : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we conquer ourselves ) speaks that we can defend ourselves by creating space in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life has neither ski@@ pped nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle for pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a Content @-@ Sharing Agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who uses and works to protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we no longer have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , poor@@ ly observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities , their stories in their way . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ts@@ rau@@ bin ) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mal@@ treatment , the announcement of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also did nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second wife moved back to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit victims of violence must be reported at all by law enforcement agencies . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that lacks nothing inferior to Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation of impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mal@@ treated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Prosecutor &apos;s Office had 9@@ 600 advertisements because of domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in peace courts . 86 % of the ads of women arrived here too . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were ab@@ used physically , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; to any woman that is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she declared end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal record , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or ex partners .
&quot; according to its estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that nothing under@@ takes
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that , she was supposed to regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psych@@ ic power on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; to name them without names , she wrote contributions to Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ically if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had liked the so long of Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ as , everything started with mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; finally , her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she conducted a trial against her ex @-@ partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known as # Prince &apos;s h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ submission ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ ly as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law that would allow the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill of law had envis@@ aged , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just want to place an ad and would like to receive a secure accommodation to give up the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this :
in Paraguay abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators come away . &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se so long ad until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
the opinions of the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the administration of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law however applies as a great set@@ back . &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ts@@ rau@@ bin ) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is sentenced to one year imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before court , but later came free . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the single sul@@ tan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , supreme commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the reign of Sul@@ t@@ ans is characterised by the har@@ sh@@ ly efforts of security forces , in particular the secret service , the public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restri@@ c@@ ting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , inti@@ mid@@ ating and det@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closing and detention three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level Parties joined the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve hands of justice . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was charged by the ISS for the special department and arrested upon arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS held the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i was held before the court in Mas@@ k@@ at . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , because of the disturb@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of public prohibition and slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ani@@ ans ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a capital punishment of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit was set in the amount of 5000 Iranian ri@@ al ( 13 000 U.S. dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the verdict of the verdict . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court pronounced Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , though Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he f@@ uses his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision by the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n to res@@ ign , the newspaper looks like attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister once again challenged the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ release the publication of the paper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times Oman has viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial chic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in ad@@ joining states by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for medical research carried out on site , there are two reasons : for a lack in the supply of global healthcare , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing , which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have severe consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic demonstrated first serious implications for national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ous health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ lic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
&quot; GV : in your opinion , what are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain benef@@ ici@@ aries instead of being makers themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or withdraw here , as financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic education , beginning at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines are accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad for the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ let , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of sal@@ ts he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain or card types . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia old tradition Mort@@ on still bre@@ ads salad , but he needs to be more difficult for this because his work is getting more and more difficult . &quot;
it &apos;s like in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to drive .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red red@@ ness of the variety Out@@ let in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather that the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can use the seed @-@ bred seed freely . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately spy - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ zed Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; &quot; in order to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; &quot; he says and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to keep their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to pat@@ enting seeds and plant features . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available genetic pool because of the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus increasingly available , shr@@ inks uns@@ ett@@ led . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of the O@@ SS@@ I , deals with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are not such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that crops such as wheat in an even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are bred so that they have specific characteristics - from them by which their taste or colour improves through to those because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through increasingly more patents . however , genetic diversity is more important than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the view that intellectual property support other breeders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others with another method to get the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; mort@@ on looks different : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed in plants that have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it becomes impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des that breed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that breeders are innovative through the avo@@ idance of plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the USA seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed company . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country where the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it refers to the current practice of the European patent office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for which scheduled next year will be the official launch . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a consortium of relief organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make clear to people that there is more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this attack and the ri@@ dic@@ ation of Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who actually defend the law , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the lock and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ or apparatus , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; Blog@@ ger , the provider of which is also native to Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting on the student protests and recorded a video , as the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article mainly revol@@ ves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to lock blogs is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block of the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege condition ; An arrest , a sought @-@ after murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it for items to handle the cens@@ orship .
&quot; now , after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way through to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities locked away from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ te also documented the c@@ abling of providers that was possible through the enc@@ ro@@ achment of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how to block web pages that V@@ PN@@ s started . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content on the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis with which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .
&quot; the Brazilian army is in use in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day newspapers in Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ government organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . , however , what happens from civil@@ ised standard and what happens only in Rio , is published in the section &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ruin in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 there are areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; mean more than they use ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira contra@@ di@@ cts the violence as a war . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country , according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are located in the north and north @-@ east of the country . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mur@@ als per federal state , Rio is in No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the biggest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; to these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit installed by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police order and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . however , after several years , the U@@ PP took over chic@@ anes and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited from one of his articles from the year 2010 where he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; because this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil war is an in@@ significant point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; mistaken spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week later , the police kill the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died due to shots that the police fired from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : si@@ ege Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institutes , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 was severely affected by the life of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas have been controlled by rebel controlled areas outside Damascus , leading to the fact that local inhabitants are dependent on local or tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become in@@ accessible to large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional ones cultivated in Syria , and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and reli@@ eved its relief that it is now more and more . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge for planting mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to cand@@ o by Monday , the 4th September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced prop@@ ell@@ ants are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of mushroom seeds , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege becomes visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many regional capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were gr@@ en@@ ched in the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October .
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire break@@ outs , spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite shots , in 2017 alone , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;

Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Federal Government of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the forest reform , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity by the case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val leads in the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , are still spreading like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to these problems comes to the fact that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative which provided the population with information : it used its own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire department and was so crucial in October that the server stopped the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , and did not count on the website more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew that she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .
the city of G@@ haz@@ ni in Afghanistan .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt protected . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; a few years later , he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar , who were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ qi came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago , A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high rein@@ forcement quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres , &quot; which are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum , which can still be drawn for months after registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast lim@@ unch .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of the companies operating in Afghanistan have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals extend far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industry and retail and aim back to the country that he had to leave forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I have never forgotten my country , and I cannot live happily , if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
&quot; they represent half of society , and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packing and conservation techniques . &quot; thus they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; ne@@ tizen &apos;s report : bills from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ edle Report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill , which provides that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to register to use social networks , registered within six months following a successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
anyone who fails this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the tri@@ b@@ ulation of a criminal off@@ ense .
&quot; the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of Parliament , is currently submitted to the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ ly pen@@ alties would be introduced to ins@@ ult the president or high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the law of law , such a fact would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is to be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograp@@ hed Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the resolution of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison management failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the floo@@ ding of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and succ@@ essive assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ic activists inter@@ rog@@ ated documents
&quot; Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ rog@@ ated to a sent action plan . said plan stems from the President of the Republic , which according to the plan would explicitly guarantee a controversial bill of law , which would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption charged officer am@@ nesty , provided they have all un@@ law@@ fully preserved funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , thro@@ ws a light on how the form@@ ative plans will look to support the bill of law . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on May 9th , as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations by the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media need permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
the rules also indicate that registration will be required with the full name .
analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is up to now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens proposed this regulation only sel@@ ectively to protect civil journ@@ alism and independence .
do we then look at &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the State Government as &quot; Organ@@ izer of Information Dis@@ semination . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; these websites include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed Wiki@@ pedi@@ as to Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has been shut down because it was &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to raise a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
&quot; after this week , documents sent through this week are in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
