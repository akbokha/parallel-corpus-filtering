<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this land had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts as a law student who was willing to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very warmer love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he transforms with his narrow-face.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never holds behind the mountain, as you say so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number one of the nominees nominated by the Party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoty person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trumps's worldview did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life long the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to Kristi Kappes's commitment that always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump got his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, one of my friends said, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most of whom are white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt upon those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(N.B.):" "denying the whites against all other ethnicities" "; pun from white in reference to the whites and Whiplash, which meant so much as Schleudertrauma), as the great Van Jones called, has just killed what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a vast majority of the white America's promise and says," Hell with diversity, freedom of religion, and the whole concept of pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "roared the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music, which is played at both places, has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now the La banda de m√∫sica (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them."</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for their drug abuse and the gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically above on the largest garbage dump of Asunci√≥n in Paraguays capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with restored instruments made of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Ch√°vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the rubbish The children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about a billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practised solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a perpetrator of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilised themselves against the ship. they refused to run one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, due to the pillage of fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO Stop Illegal fishing (stop illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"apart from Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that were expelled from their bodies at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are like minded and work together. they exchange information and interact with each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that can be noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas, such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such tests can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were travelling and possibly whether they have a penal region."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay sentences as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of nfds Africa. the latter is a adviser who advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fantasies, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbridled control system," "says Long." "in the past a ship could be caught illegally and a country could then say" "You don't want to run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and precisely this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that will help FISH-i, suspecting suspicious ships more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to trace the illegal ships."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to conceal their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO dedicated to fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be controlled by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that combines different levels of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of every single traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them off."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that were exploited without licence earlier, and hardly expected to expect consequences, now know they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses since then."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped detecting Greko 1, the inspectors found there towing networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With security, the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions is said," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first great triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the behaviour of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way of working to protect the oceans is actually functioning throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, New York Times and the Guardian."</seg>
<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the resolution of President Nicol√°s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">"after the government's government rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into void by gathering on the streets."</seg>
<seg id="158">"under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (e.g.: the repatriation of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found."</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among others in the region of Barinas, in the regions of M√©rida and T√°chira, in the central north of the country of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>

<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition have the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol√°s Maduro, but in the end, the reluctance to re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne D√≠az, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine was considered, the referendum was considered to be the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="199">"when he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of C√≥rdoba."</seg>
<seg id="200">"as an adult man, Quijano said in the course of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in Cordoba against his father."</seg>
<seg id="201">"in the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting from the office, carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magent.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>
<seg id="208">"I couldn't realize then that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in La Perla prison."</seg>

<seg id="213">"no, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and he testified of a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father."</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child has chosen a path of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">"when my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts."</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and some days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>

<seg id="225">"I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine, because so my father had educated me."</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="229">'There are prisoners being tortured</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack in which cars, furniture, television, fridges - were simply everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packing wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were put off and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it was attached to that one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just encircled there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely associate a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured it with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisi√≥n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrible... like a dirty windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that it is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forgot this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound with handcuffs and were bound to the eye."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose L√≥pez, a civilian who was also accused in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay down with the face downward - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people sat still on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"" "why did you bring me down?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">"they were thrown into a pit, and were killed and buried by soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero killed a man there and killed a man.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to survivors, Jorge Romero, who was also accused of the La Perla-Ribera trial, was indicted by the students Ra√∫l Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came here is also the way on which the abductions came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look on the map, you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement from the top came that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - Euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War Crimean'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at age I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military, I was in Gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war crimes are a bayonet or maybe military badges, which you have fought against an enemy."</seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quijano with his son.</seg>
<seg id="272">Archival recording</seg>
<seg id="273">"but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator, the record player, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then this is not war crime but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">"I was an officer at the gendarmerie, and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it."</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered: and you, who stole cars on the street?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded against anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">"for that, we need no one else!"</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roller pullover of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense, a conspirator accused me of this crime. I answered, no problem, they can put me on the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to say.</seg>
<seg id="290">"" "the disappearance of the dead is the last disgusting act" ""</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you have been executing people during the dictatorship. but why do the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl with home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I asked myself again and again: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess, it was simply decided to kill these people. but why do their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was introduced again, they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crammed and dispelled somewhere - no idea where." "you'll never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But something remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of showing my father was born during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all the atrocities I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," I don't know. I have killed anyone. "</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt internally displaced and asked me why the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they allegedly defended, were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something like this?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">He just said "Na then show me."</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">"in 2010, I refunded the first ad."</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can reproach me that I am preoccupied. I finally have said against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="346">Editing of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Kyoto city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong their driving license, witnessed a particularly misfuelled translation last month."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a sign the Japanese word was carried out by the Japanese word (korean-sha), which means" older motorists, "wrongly - perhaps also with malicious thoughts & # 8212; as" terrible motorists. ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1st to 20th September.</seg>
<seg id="350">"adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was made to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">"the Kyoto Shimbun, which is appearing in Kyoto, wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the incorrect English translation was initially removed. the designation" "bad drivers" "(German:" "awful drivers" ") was later replaced by the appropriate, if grammatical not quite correct designation" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ") were replaced."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt insulted by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "fearful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country, however, is quite an occasion for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and proactive language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who have no foreign employees, can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic propositions, which are produced by mechanical translations, show that this technique cannot replace any human translators for a long time. this applies especially to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, people in Paraguay are the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes her minderborn son or her inferior daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, referred to as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, as the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated to the Critic is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, on the one hand, the family who is their daughter in the faith that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes up the girl with her and justifies his exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be starved."</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunci√≥n as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went back home and had time to learn."</seg>

<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would" "learn poor habits" "there again." "they said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, would speak their mother tongue again."</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently voted for a bill" "the regulations concerning the use and use of social networks." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up in order to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of adopting the law, users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a buckle."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill consisting of six paragraphs and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video content and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should make the registration. unclear is the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill of law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password to get through the firewall, blocking Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt plans to establish a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of this, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But so far it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" executive researcher ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they have forcibly control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who seek permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to supply them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" is in accordance with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensuring that no deviating narration is present on the image area, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards, which wanders through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian leopard is the only remaining carnivorous animal in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see an Persian leopard in fact is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video therefore determines that they have a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "in Fukushima caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a fruitful prefectures in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to leave, because the tsunami had lost whole coastal towns from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"even to this end, Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, that's why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese recovery agency and survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned sparrow houses (history of the town), saigai kouei juutaku, were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi achieved the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of temporary accommodation has been made to relocate to final spare houses, even six years after the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 more than 30,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima are still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who were hauled after the disaster in homes were settled into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo magazine was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, have grown generously in the three prefectures of agrarian land."</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima, lie in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same stand, as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it seems more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuees."</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami-consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in their edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper increased its attention to the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, were settled into permanent replacement homes."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017 stand, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuation, still in temporary shelters, are older than 50 years old. it is known because efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the death, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which still grind.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>

<seg id="638">"in 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity."</seg>

<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report" Agricultural prospects "by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations."</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use hip hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording of a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N 'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with themes that are important for them. they do they through hip hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour, workshops are bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop assumes that the young participants in discussions include topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-service dance, "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where youths are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" highway of tears, "a road section in West kanada, where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">"for the most part, the cases were not elucidated."</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is, despite the influences of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always know the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstar hip-hop group who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N 'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"in this way, they can grow and proceed as well as our youth."</seg>
<seg id="712">"thus, they can do what they intended for the Creator."</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plastic models of the dishes" ") of every dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see themselves these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokidic district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is now transformed into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new mobile ribbons decorated with plastic, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin's refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences becomes increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, icura or laughing is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter? ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our new mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"other skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter to the hashtag # 5, in the event of the hashtag # 4.6 in the case of # Customization."</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi that dedicates itself to the supply of the restaurant industry. as for example with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missed and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, these mirrors not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzm√°n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never cure."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Pol√≠tico has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" to live with drug trafficking "), which is said to give this sacrifice a voice and tell stories of people who came into struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Pol√≠tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug trafficking and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video titled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "(German:" "fear lives" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodr√≠guez, who lost her father only one day, lost her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked ourselves to go and to find graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but they don't get paid off because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Pol√≠tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensational journalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I am coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with images, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminals or from acts of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent and consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he's big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, as if they were sinking those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified to be" "incessant". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to argue that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months of blackmail in the main town district: how a family was plundered with threats. "in this, she describes how armed criminal month paid money from her business until it destroyed not only the business, but also tore her family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life completely in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain about it never goes, the trauma remains, fear comes back again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are removed from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, if weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Guti√©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Ju√°rez: a generation drawn by force."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, tortillas and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw, which had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born as Bryan, the situation in Ju√°rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju√°rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Ju√°rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Citizen's Council for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories still live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Pol√≠tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misleading to manipulating tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false pairing of image and event -" false description "or" false context "in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected for many years and devastated."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank truck fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses covered including a movie theater nearby, which was full of people who watched the football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and stolen corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" This is Nigeria. "by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">"it shows rows of salted bodies, which are strung along the floor while people look at them."</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been researched several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." "no one stayed back to count corpses," "said an inhabitant of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up period could be visually displayed."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris. "</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misallocation; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all of these cases, the image was presented as evidence of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further brings personal comments like this example wrongly the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to providing arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash message, published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported on the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following were posted, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from a Saudi-Arab news site, which happened in 2012, the President Myanmars Thein Sein have said that monk and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to image this information."</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>

<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally share the water around tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and are the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equal to the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitized and have the ability to feel empathy (such as this study investigating how violent media help others to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss with forcible representations in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake news". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used as a part of the context or completely abusive species."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, every examination of false write-downs should also take into account how internationally they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">"a blog named Untranslatable (e.g. unsurpassable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not at all to translate."</seg>

<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others which are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobrimesa).</seg>

<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" Untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the Vlap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>

<seg id="1135">"story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0."</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Corporate Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"recently, Global Voices reported a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unmatched blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and honour the linguistic diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk of small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities, accept diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often linked to understanding, these events instead" listening to appreciate, feel, to make. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and representation are leading to the fact that the audience is involved in it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of the Hasen and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his fabel, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is this to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a broad grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story narrative performances."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which was over 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march started at the puerning Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de Col√≥n in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was called by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditor√≠a de la Deuda" (civic front for the neural examination of the debt) and the ecumenical church meeting of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reorganization of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico demanded that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is available royalty-free, contains a series of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is said:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feed and to create some sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory section of his book, entitled Collective Memory, gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own fates, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police" "were on the basis of a" "strictly secret" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">But its whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently passes the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded basset, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Baska's cultural prototypes was more provisionary than the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of many civilizations and here Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would expose everything to this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"bassel taught me English, even when he was detained."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a proclamation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was detained."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, where corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"it is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants on account of contamination of 54 million Metical (approximately 800 000 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public money from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was preceded by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19 then."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Attorney General's Attorney General's Attorney General, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people don't like the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade P√∫blica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle."</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary approach against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company seems to be silent and does not induce appropriate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Eg√≠dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "disgusting" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and of which half had to eat."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to become reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director lacks any morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he insulted him, I cannot believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already massively insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality to return and to serve the state, but has had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served itself on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Ze√∫te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, not only to be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, cutting-edge and - incidentally - prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral depictions was when he affirmed that" "an ambitious person is capable of all, also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it's not that way. he changes the tactic, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is at the same time criminal. "</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spider veins.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although there is still discussion about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar, "or, as part of an initiative, to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hatred in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call for hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same letter sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was extinguished today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "Healing" "(ku) + the question (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Halls is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before spreading all posts which are suspected of being racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism is not understood what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead is carefully analyzing the post, checking it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar pae" "(spider bins)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, spreading the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative writing of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to copy, post and share content for 24 hours because the post" failed to meet the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a huge turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks auto censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which have no hate speech but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should in addition heighten violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of refugees to escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for its failure, the proliferating hate speech on its Burmese pages."</seg>

<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously adopted a law that should prohibit this practice so that the marriage-capable age is now at 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"at that time, Brother HarryPerad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organisation (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, since that, age does not determine maturity."</seg>

<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and 18 were 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, trying to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to tell the critics of the children's marriage they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated issue, and at some point there was no doubt whether the opposition would agree with the draft law."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which has once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and none of them decided against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after he was previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws were finally changed for children's marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Lovell Francis, who clothed a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk, which has concealed the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price."</seg>
<seg id="1361">"while Abel Jackson was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to finish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:"</seg>

<seg id="1365">"Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law, noted:"</seg>

<seg id="1367">"the draft on the amendment of the spouse has been decided today, on 9 June 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1377">"during the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law said it was quite legitimate, if Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject."</seg>

<seg id="1379">"rather sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion as general, in a way that can only induce panic and disgrace if we, rather than talking about the problem that the state, our daughters guard against them, would be misused by large, hard-faced men that are compared to them, would you then be ready to continue the discussion?"</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">"but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children's marriage is legal or still the norm, although there are laws that they prohibit."</seg>

<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a Suhlende Nashorn, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera in himself and try to engrave the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar has tried to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was, and I immediately started to crush pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar is striving for a cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature, and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so terrifying as they look like."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he was already standing by face to face toward him, saying,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the bug appeared. he immediately goes, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for promoting Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, that live near the tourist information."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalympa and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India it avoids women with greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband due to social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should abuse the norm to preserve this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo-court and violated by her family and community after she had addressed a married relationship with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives is also not to be called by the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less fear to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, competed in a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the refinement of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paware works for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected, and manages these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion, was women who did not call her husbands on behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak out loud in the name of her husbands, is a custom that she is all guilty and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not conceal this, is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf up to now, wanted to try out at home as it was going."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent long after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him on his name from now on."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this confidence in luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does it mean that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "said Rohini Pawar from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the crushing of an age-old tradition in which married women never allowed to speak the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, she was only cautious about him; another decided to release the whole stroke of frustration against him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she got afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the tine-red dot on the forehead, which indicates the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberthy point if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not ceased completely, but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at any discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who what to hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in recent months, they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things like our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since her marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a salted curta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own fashion choice, morality linked with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed somewhat, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the wheels:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only made small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped telling the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggle for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club goes home and other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from demarcated groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news from those they experience themselves, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1553">It became clear to people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"the music of the cult band is" more than just a universal language like English, "Ryuichi Isaka told, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review."</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for" "Subversion" "(state endangering) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "an internal matter" "and a spokesman said he did not consider it as" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, allowing him to leave or treat him abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister B√∏rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government hastened that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to re-record the salmon exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on July 6, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomats of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as she said in an explanation on 30 June:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"they should meet and receive all visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokesperson in the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US Embassy drew an angry response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom such as freedom of access and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns if the host could overshadow Liu's visit to Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada (in english)</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called for China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Lius lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact."</seg>

<seg id="1668">France (Germany)</seg>
<seg id="1669">"in a statement on June 29, France's Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:"</seg>

<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been strictly punished, had led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter signed by Liu Xiaobo, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian creators who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He refused appropriate questions with non-answers rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our cheap K Shanmugam would take the effort to clear this point, as long as it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more of a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneasy, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said," "Singapore is no country," "he obviously does not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment on Shanmugam as a leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Singapore minister of Justice said,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but this is another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam," "sinned a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role in the cabinet of government, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore make their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister need to pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our rosa identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the journal Journey of a Decade tends to affirm, Singapore is and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">"the question that is most asked me in Japan is:" "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I'll answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and back in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place, it is deemed to be polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians may cook internally with anger if they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>

<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means to be diligent - just like the good-natured, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has one's own Canadian Doppelg√§nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing on which one can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if one wants to remain unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far, to say that the desire to be free and alone is a leading part of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps simply cool courtesy.</seg>

<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued in the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of girls "possibly refer to the draconical section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the Commander-in-Chief of the Healer absolute decision making over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program of" setting change "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are regarded by the junta as critics."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ram√≠rez tells the people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the time it is rather quiet, but this year Ram√≠rez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also have slept outside on boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them medication they cannot pay, she massaged them with a balsam the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already speaking on Whatsapp from Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs Ram√≠rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "he answers smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ram√≠rez tells her guests often send text messages, when they have gone to greet them or to report on the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ram√≠rez is perhaps well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jes√∫s Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cookery outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencia declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a solo traveler, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go to the next steps."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the passageways, the traveller consults quietly their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ram√≠rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she blends in her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots, which she has made an artist, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, the"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are compelled to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone user in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it assigns the District Government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app" prevent access to terrorist information. ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than just fighting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web sites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focus on users' experience in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, afflicted ethnic minorities like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to reduce unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme assurances and monitoring measures as well as routinely internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet, based on Twitter, published the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the inhabitants indiscriminately if they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the rest of the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" "China" "also published a Jingwang product description, resulting from the fact that the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and therefore receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang might be a reaction to the instructions of the City party council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, a US human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos.

<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or if it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intertwined together to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour, three of them differed from them while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling and didn't find any pleasure in it, which is why he was next to an electrically charged stick."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed all my body, enough to supply all my quarters."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect current leader."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again again; let's say, that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which happened to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an inexhaustible youth:" "my Lord, my father has to worry about terrible worries."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and go away, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they always had me released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he narrows to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes even to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips to discover with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family fled to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyees (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questions its well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through borders, and he can feel the disastrous consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he turns against the US foreign policy a special reluctance."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has something to do with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation, "he calls himself even when he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he solves Nescaf√© in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan, and in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensing hot young couple has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the slings speak lukewarm coffee and the shavers of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when looking into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert statement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the deputies and former press spokespersons in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had just been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila valued the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continue to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be simply seizure rhetoric, but actually reflected in Jordan's clear-crystallizing reality, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to Leibe's traditional sex men by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently unmarried woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of" honor murders "has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to the Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders reached its peak in 2016; however, Jordan's institutional infrastructure is still lacking in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law banning crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of infamilial violence must be detained at indefinite time in prison, and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary that the woman will not happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"even Hdaib's music is very popular, and is known to shy away from issues that are long considered taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became a politician," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib calls on the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political at the heart can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words," "that can get what you want" "- be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of homosexuals and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to memorize his comments from the context, twisted, and censored his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but was only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service held several former government officials and members of the teaching alliance, arguing that they had critically voiced concerns on comments in social media, which coincided with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will bring about real and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not through bombs, dispersions and artificially induced democracies. at least, it hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is, Hdaib will continue to zap and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to the Student Fellow."</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many parts of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing were deployed over more than one thousand years to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of the capital of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street smoke and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru experiences as many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which takes place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools, and instead of poor advice to obtain an education in the hairdressing art that allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities presented have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year starting in March, the school offered special educational workshops and reported some of their achievements:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the article" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel expelled, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question was precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo P√°rraga from the Foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, inspired them to write letters to the campaign Carta por la reconciliaci√≥n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla warfare FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"in International, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jos√© Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"but before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillakfighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out their arms round the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young Colombians would join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter who will then be personally handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgent attention."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotart Foundation entered the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up the way they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of shelter from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between, "the political science student Manuela Jim√©nez Avila told later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former militant led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambusches" "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what do you do right now?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected something else from life as war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how social injustice has appeared on the part of the state to the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never found hearing and had no right to vote, and to recognize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful emotions were very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men, too, who have killed and so much damage done, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have replied to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians have been prophesied that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the past few months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damoclesworth over the LGBTQ community is not only about overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago, after reports published that addressed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who captured suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transformer, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens experienced by the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she moved to the United States last week."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transformer stuck in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on 10 October 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying," Here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long will you still dishonour the family, you Schandfleck? ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which sicknesses have you been placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated and my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked me absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by going upstairs without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have a cup size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the entire republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she took a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later I was standing under the window a car with darkened window panes and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights Friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registration, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe, you were in security, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality, this is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this mental barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person to look out of her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have been dordant?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who fed into argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this, I mean, they probably load the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are still gay men in these secret prisons detained?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: an acquaintance of me says that there were not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to make Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there were no reports until now. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called" "non-traditional" "orientation have already occurred in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in quite Great Britain when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to lead us to" "civilisation", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had coloured eyelashes and wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Sharia never has curved me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Spots are not about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just shut their eyes closed before you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiled and laughed before, gazed at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was constantly worsening."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreff, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I abdicated influenza.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, which has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam before the mouth, that there are no owls at them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist, but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's uncomfortable to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think about transitions to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trustworthiness."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things, two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not so sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong rise in self-murder."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th led the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered under anxiety, depression, and he pleaded for his own helplessness to be able to raise the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegrad hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the incinerators were so strong that doctors couldn't do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: they were all family patricians, who felt helpless and incapable of pursuing their families because of persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and incapable of pursuing their families."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, where most of the Arab Ahwazi community lives in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population gets only little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime has refused to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of tribes, the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to the devastation caused by drought caused by drought, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, resident in London, said Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment, and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "in the number of suicides among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"for this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities and an anti-Arab discrimination in the adjustment process is a combination of a high number of new ethnic groups and an anti-Arab discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activist activates alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, also with the intersectionals"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afrof√©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on sex continues through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black female women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused by racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and 'Kumbaya' to sing my Lord 'to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence that we face black women in two-fold manner."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women to have equal rights to all men and all men at all; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which refers to both the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women and again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical terms is a mere and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to animate them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectionale feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and limit themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join me of the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, so stubbornly is that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana perhaps: Reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we conquer ourselves) speaks that we can defend ourselves by creating space in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life has neither skipped nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2468">"as part of a Content-Sharing Agreement, this article will be re-published here."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa travelled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in the canoe - with a special concern by the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who uses and works to protect rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>

<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary film and multimedia journalist."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weilicheintsraubin) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada B√°ez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police said, her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena due to maltreatment, the announcement of Ada B√°ez also did nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife moved back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit victims of violence must be reported at all by law enforcement agencies."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 Strike and Statistical 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system that lacks nothing inferior to Paraguays laws: good approach, deficient implementation of impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really maltreated, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Prosecutor's Office had 9600 advertisements because of domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in peace courts. 86% of the ads of women arrived here too."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were abused physically, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "to any woman that is refunded in Paraguay for mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she declared end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal record, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"only by August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or ex partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to its estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that nothing undertakes</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Br√≠tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning she didn't want to do that, but after that, she was supposed to regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychic power on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"to name them without names, she wrote contributions to Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>

<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament which was known as # Prince's hashtag # Porellas."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-submission) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="2552">"the reign of Sultans is characterised by the harshly efforts of security forces, in particular the secret service, the public liberties, including press freedom, restricting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, intimidating and detained."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"for the need for medical research carried out on site, there are two reasons: for a lack in the supply of global healthcare, many medicines and vaccines are missing, which cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have severe consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic demonstrated first serious implications for national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched himself on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sambous health system."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">"Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samblic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"GV: in your opinion, what are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?"</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always remain beneficiaries instead of being makers themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>

<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic education, beginning at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad for the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outlet, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of salts he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain or card types."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition Morton still breads salad, but he needs to be more difficult for this because his work is getting more and more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to drive.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavours to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red redness of the variety Outlet in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather that the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" Open Source "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can use the seed-bred seed freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately spy - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerized Professor of the University of Wisconsin Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." "in order to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," "he says and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to keep their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patenting seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available genetic pool because of the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus increasingly available, shrinks unsettled."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, director of the OSSI, deals with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are not such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that crops such as wheat in an even greater style are patented as lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they have specific characteristics - from them by which their taste or colour improves through to those because they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through increasingly more patents. however, genetic diversity is more important than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property support other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"morton looks different: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed in plants that have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it becomes impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and OSSI, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breeds a variety, also breeds his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides that breed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders are innovative through the avoidance of plant patents:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a few years," he says. "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it easy for my opinion." "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seems to be leading in the" open source "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed company."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country where the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it refers to the current practice of the European patent office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Open Source" seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for "Open Source" seed systems, for which scheduled next year will be the official launch. "</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international Nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a consortium of relief organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make clear to people that there is more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the above."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"in spite of this attack and the ridication of Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who actually defend the law, it has never been as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the lock and not to give up. we insist on fulfilling our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network because of alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he directed to bypass the Egyptian government's censor apparatus, became the target of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"Blogger, the provider of which is also native to Ziadas's blog, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting on the student protests and recorded a video, as the police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article mainly revolves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to lock blogs is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the block of the blog might not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible to give me the feeling of a siege condition; An arrest, a sought-after murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it for items to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"now, after having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way through to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities locked away from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"in addition, afte also documented the cabling of providers that was possible through the encroachment of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how to block web pages that VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content on the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis with which they can proceed against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-government organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crime, etc., however, what happens from civilised standard and what happens only in Rio, is published in the section" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Oct√°vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ruin in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 there are areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>

<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of mafia and its partners."</seg>

<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cec√≠lia Oliveira contradicts the violence as a war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2781">"to these security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Pol√≠cia Pacificadora), a police unit installed by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by using a massive police order and permanently stationing a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. however, after several years, the UPP took over chicanes and repressions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under attack."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist Jo√£o Paulo Charleaux cited from one of his articles from the year 2010 where he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention on the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"because this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes the penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "where a civil war is an insignificant point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" mistaken spheres. ""</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institutes, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib about one million Syrians in a state of siege."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 was severely affected by the life of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these areas have been controlled by rebel controlled areas outside Damascus, leading to the fact that local inhabitants are dependent on local or tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the longlasting blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become inaccessible to large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the traditional ones cultivated in Syria, and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Directorate of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and relieved its relief that it is now more and more."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge for planting mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of approximately 12,700 ‚Ç¨, but will continue to collect donations to cando by Monday, the 4th September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ¬∞ C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced propellants are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" production of mushroom seeds, "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi throughout Eastern Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons" ": breaking the siege."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on October 21, several hundred people protested in many regional capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were grenched in the north of Portugal in the week before."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breakouts, spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June a similar tragedy happened in Pedr√≥g√£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forestry surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite shots, in 2017 alone, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People asked why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">Jo√£o Soveral from the Federal Government of Portugal declared the paper P√∫blico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedr√≥g√£o, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">"this Sunday, they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire."</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could happen again as in June, as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"in addition, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the forest reform, which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity by the case if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," Jo√£o Sorval leads in the same article in the newspaper P√∫blico. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, are still spreading like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"to these problems comes to the fact that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative which provided the population with information: it used its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo√£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire department and was so crucial in October that the server stopped the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires, and did not count on the website more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt protected."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"a few years later, he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him ill."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, who were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharqi came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time ago, Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high reinforcement quotas. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" special reception centres, "which are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum, which can still be drawn for months after registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years, Ashark stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast limunch.</seg>

<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of the companies operating in Afghanistan have emerged, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>

<seg id="2932">"the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill, which provides that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"users would have to register to use social networks, registered within six months following a successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who fails this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the tribulation of a criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was advertised by sixty members of Parliament, is currently submitted to the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal in which harshly penalties would be introduced to insult the president or high officials."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under the law of law, such a fact would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"if the law is to be adopted, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan), who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen, demonstrating against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the resolution of elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants arrested at the same incident, four years in jail for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed on 20 May, because the prison management failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom according to human rights groups."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree on the flooding of weapons, illegal assembly, murder and successive assassination."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their coverage of pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo."</seg>

<seg id="2947">"Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated to a sent action plan. said plan stems from the President of the Republic, which according to the plan would explicitly guarantee a controversial bill of law, which would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption charged officer amnesty, provided they have all unlawfully preserved funds."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21 on the website of Nawaat, throws a light on how the formative plans will look to support the bill of law."</seg>

<seg id="2954">The rules also indicate that registration will be required with the full name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
