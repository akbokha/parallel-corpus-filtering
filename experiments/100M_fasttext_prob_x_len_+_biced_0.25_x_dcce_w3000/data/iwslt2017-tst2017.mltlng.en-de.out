this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA has heard illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation , in which the CIA literally handed down dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not coinci@@ de with the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against Ris@@ en and promp@@ ted him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became the symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional review , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to jail . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , despite the fact that it was essential for their case for years , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
&quot; instead of failure and tear@@ ing to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are worried about his phone numbers , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even travel references with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload or send documents , just as with any common contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that all je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to make mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers , who wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for poll@@ uted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der who warned us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data sheet of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a saying : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of USD 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent writer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are not enough Americans to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , there is less information in some US states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
che@@ aters are allowed to rip especially vulnerable fe@@ eder .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked us that all up to one lawyer made suggestions about how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our concealed investigation .
&quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a native optim@@ ist I see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen incidents of greater transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end by laws this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally finish the In@@ transparency , which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood still and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aking on to@@ e tips to the door , and my bedroom door shut . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood , actually friends , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost flat , my ro@@ ommate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such a &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ etts ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and fell the door into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came to the roll .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept .
&quot; thus we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild humans to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; when one has a problem , one contempl@@ ates the things that one can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked cell phone to your left sitting area .
this silent flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
&quot; because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel like staying elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is can@@ di@@ zing for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had only presented with his name ? if he had told wh@@ ence he came from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well sprung hands !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to cast negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their jud@@ gements before we placed them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence . &quot;
not surprisingly we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through judgments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation encourages com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ dile@@ ction .
we also learned that confidence depends on how much you cost .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- but the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I am making a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics one should write about .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; with what we did not reck@@ on , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need not covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction had a problem . &quot;
for men trusted each other in judgment .
&quot; when trust works , it can create won@@ dro@@ us things . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to have a heart attack due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true guar@@ dian angels who save life , even though they don &apos;t know it properly . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring down books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay does not work . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but now it is just &quot; &quot; lease industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people lay a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; if you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you were visiting , a group there would be waiting to be able to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood of a pub that you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design flats from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of common participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces owned by the government , &quot;
&quot; were now offered residents . students who were looking for a stay , &quot;
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were dra@@ fted , and incub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were already similar sites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think it &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
&quot; I have to think about it every time , when a red Maz@@ da goes past me . &quot;
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design for the future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
studies show : the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met Muslims , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
&quot; a car@@ rot @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual muscle . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress thy@@ self ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , with the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and im@@ meas@@ urable beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only accept the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ asted with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to crying .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet love somehow ? &quot;
so it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; rush announcement . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people rus@@ hed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should one do such things ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid @-@ West of the USA to go to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I drove myself -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations said , &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; and again the warnings said : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged and struck them . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims to ban mos@@ ques and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is incorrect .
&quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the US &apos;s body but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ as . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
&quot; there may be some parking lots , but do not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has noticed that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ cour@@ aged by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality they can read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
a prominent Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , kept her to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if one reports messages in which negative reports were reported on Muslims , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood sw@@ ung up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ls us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the faculty of denti@@ stry , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man come out of my breasts ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went into the hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , as half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to help us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have met a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ talk , a mind@@ set with draft are working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a milli@@ ar@@ dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air pack@@ ets drive into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six metre high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in a tight space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ level@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; every aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Shipping : € 10.Attention european and german buyers : we allow you to bid on this auction , but you need to add the vat of 19 % .
&quot; a flight unit , which tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the starter drivers , it can float , and thus has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind @-@ bows .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in which position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often place basic abstract questions which are at the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilot operated remote @-@ controlled flying machines , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ ate , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it exactly right when all of you watch is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the monster is an exercise in nau@@ sea , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is just symmet@@ rical .
that &apos;s why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; by doing so , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things are imagin@@ able in models , the rest will be learned directly at the fly . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if aircraft are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller is eliminated , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making one half of fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercially available micro Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages are in development and the act of creation . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in so spectacular manner . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they g@@ lowed bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire Universe . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was em@@ itted into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events in the first place .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group decided to build more courage@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes passed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically this was the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ utter in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pun@@ ched in the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses on the Theory of Rel@@ ativity often perform a properly al@@ ber@@ n@@ ated dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even lu@@ dic@@ rous , are . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ acked by us when the waves hit . the elong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties during construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are resour@@ c@@ eful , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : face lifts , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sounds , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you a lot : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to specific properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob dis@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ky Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make any easy pictures of objects in the universe with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally listen to the All . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , about the coll@@ ision of two black holes can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott is busy already very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ate simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; when the two bodies rotate very quickly , one hears the same circle with an additional key change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of motion , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear , recognizes this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate about as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- not to see .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ aque are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves pier@@ ce iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ g@@ low . &quot;
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and that is the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sour no@@ ises for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I rehear@@ sed an experiment .
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected item . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; guess , I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on I swear to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a surprising side effect : only recently , I understood completely that the &quot; yes &quot; sag@@ a for playing with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things get up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce TV .
&quot; I am making television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying 70 hours of program to the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days with four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts at the same time : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running after each other on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I must find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you , so that all of you who work so hard whether you are now a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a classroom , take me seriously if I talk about work so that you can understand that I am not just walking around on the computer and fan@@ ta@@ si@@ ere , and it is true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that there &apos;s no dream on a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , you have a high sound , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , if I declare to them the sums , that I &apos;m persu@@ aded that writing is my pleasure . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I started to work and work and work , build , create and work , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the Sum@@ ma is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can no longer strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more crowded limits , the more work there is , the more things get me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the sums .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single employer .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums ceased . &quot;
the sum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my sums were broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me silence was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I simply had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sums and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love is suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the sums if you stop the sums , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things are aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I hate it when I am Titan , and my sums are rus@@ hing , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and nur@@ ture their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of labour , the title of titanium , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sums are no force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
real sums depend on love .
the Sum@@ ma is the current that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum is simple and original .
&quot; real sums are God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , because what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t agree on how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at home than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a man rather works than being at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we move around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I mostly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the games ?
&quot; you can also do it ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think that they want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie will replace me .
&quot; and talking my teen@@ y daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the Year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for more . &quot;
everyone can take 15 minutes per piece even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes at play !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to deal with . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my feel @-@ good , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the sums , to have a place for peace . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not allow for a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return when I do not work .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sums , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum now .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work are part of me , but just a part . I am so thank@@ ful for that . &quot;
&quot; I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the screens , the high clay , the sums , the other , the right sum : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , moving , naked and new feeling of life within me is broad . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am an author . I think things , I raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self healing . &quot;
&quot; after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason I was functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; certainly , they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , you im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ert an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
history started 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior doctor and worked in the emergency room day and night .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that the brain oscill@@ ates the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life you have to reduce the skull pressure .
&quot; for this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to succeed . &quot;
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they are made up of 4 % of our cereb@@ ral pal@@ sy cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we mat@@ ured them at the origin of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we mature these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we mature the same cells in weak@@ ened brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we mat@@ ured the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared after a few weeks as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury to and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets from one tablet .
that made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured the mot@@ orized c@@ ort@@ ex in the motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they spontan@@ eously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of pl@@ asti@@ ty brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the monkey that spontan@@ eously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we mat@@ ured the cells : the same monkey , two months after the m@@ aturing . &quot;
I can tell you that they were also very exciting for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ate them with human beings .
&quot; I really hope , that I can soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority permit us to start soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ entr@@ e study . &quot;
first of all it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable ge@@ ther@@ ness .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance ministers in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to affect the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are aver@@ ted , our future ble@@ w and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin @-@ dy@@ e .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , which however are too fear@@ ful to invest there where it would be productive and in@@ comes to produce all the things that humanity needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and the euro area , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds a lot of money until you compare it with the $ 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to c@@ row out the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin tops , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe unemployed , which , like in a final loop , advoc@@ ate the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , like in a final loop , encourage the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , that his son would kill him if he is er@@ ased , &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally causes the circumstances leading to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely extravag@@ ant kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and naturally slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote weigh@@ ting in matters of the state prosec@@ utor . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ ic democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our democr@@ acies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , as the economy gradually under@@ went politics and ma@@ stered it . &quot;
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a de@@ generation of its DNA .
&quot; it is because it can be in the government today , and yet not in power , because the power of politics is mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my veins with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they nour@@ ished , that they end up being star@@ ved at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , political goods are de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; democr@@ ats &quot; re@@ tains control , just like in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Mar@@ xi@@ an Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more bear@@ er , and social conflicts more deeply , just as I believe -- will come in countries such as China . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; thus , the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; or something that the company is in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; in the machines , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; to indul@@ ge in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all income derived from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction is between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees working there , but they do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no rag@@ ing tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that you did not have the technical means at that time .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ anism . &quot;
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we collec@@ tively decide politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... does not we do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally unt@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have told very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , if I can say this so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can observe now in China is similar to the evolution we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now that China is propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells huge amounts of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers from Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I warned that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good @-@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the per@@ sever@@ ing den@@ ial that a massive fault line ran through the Eurozone and continues to massi@@ vely je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the euro@@ zone , have also elected the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to get alive through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were going through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders imposed on this policy was : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be bear@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard the most , although he is probably responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ conditioner and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
&quot; will show your show at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where , after you watched a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium output , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t enth@@ use . &quot;
so he has to make sure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is there , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price no longer want to risk . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is out for nothing , it &apos;s true ? &quot;
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon was supposed to make Sit@@ com about four repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it slightly different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows , their course they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , what producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the pieces together , they went a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; you have two very competitive , data vers@@ ed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic is somehow that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet then you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working so , this is a bit fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the bad type , they can predict -- by data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year by year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life - at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions about how the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you disman@@ tle this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the items back together to make a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to reset the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is part and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete to then grasp a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . however , the decision of how to take all of these parts and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; didn &apos;t stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they chose TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; &quot; We tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is useful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will f@@ lick it later with a demo demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life so far , I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
