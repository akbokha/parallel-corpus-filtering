<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA has heard illegal telephones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation, in which the CIA literally handed down drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not coincide with the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and prompted him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became the symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional review, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, despite the fact that it was essential for their case for years, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and tearing to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, are worried about his phone numbers,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit, and even travel references with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"we therefore put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that has not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload or send documents, just as with any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that all jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to ensure that not only technology denominators such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to make misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers, who wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for polluted water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider who warned us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data sheet of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca saying:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of USD 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent writer or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are not enough Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, there is less information in some US states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Cheaters are allowed to rip especially vulnerable feeder.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to one lawyer made suggestions about how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our concealed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very trivial as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing has ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a native optimist I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen incidents of greater transparency concerning the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say," "Intransparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end by laws this kind of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally finish the Intransparency, which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stood still and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," Ah, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I get there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaking on toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door shut."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood, actually friends, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost flat, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such a "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-Omeletts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and fell the door into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"thus we presented the investors:" we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite wild humans to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still very consolation, would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"when one has a problem, one contemplates the things that one can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone to your left sitting area.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most guests feel like staying elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like who now has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candizing for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had only presented with his name? if he had told whence he came from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really capture very well sprung hands!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to cast negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their judgements before we placed them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly we trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's reputation -- in our case through judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation encourages commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted predilection.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that confidence depends on how much you cost.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" "-- but the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I am making a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics one should write about.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we did not reckon, the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trusted each other in judgment.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, it can create wondrous things."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to have a heart attack due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels who save life, even though they don't know it properly."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring down books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay does not work."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is just" "lease industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of themselves openly, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you were visiting, a group there would be waiting to be able to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood of a pub that you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design flats from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of common participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable society and relationships, instead of solitude and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces owned by the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"were now offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were drafted, and incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be so crazy about how it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think it's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"I have to think about it every time, when a red Mazda goes past me."</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design for the future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met Muslims, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>

<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "why do you suppress thyself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, with the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and immeasurable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wasted with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, asked, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that someone you perceives you, you fully understand, and yet love somehow?"</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" rush announcement. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people rushed out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such things?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "Djihad..."... "" "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it was not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Mid-West of the USA to go to a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I drove myself -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations said," Be watchful, "" Be careful, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well-lit areas, "" Don't be sampled. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings said:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were held for Muslims, dragged and struck them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims to ban mosques and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the US's body but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are the inventors and teachers, helpers and Olympias."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be some parking lots, but do not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"regular visit to a mosque leads to more tolerant people, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has noticed that it starts online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or discouraged by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one looks at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality they can read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A prominent Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. each clergyman with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization through extremists that promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, kept her to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if one reports messages in which negative reports were reported on Muslims, they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood swung up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well-informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurls us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the faculty of dentistry, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when did such a young man come out of my breasts?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanaticism cannot be immoral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took it out, pulled out my shoes, went into the hall, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, as half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to help us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>

<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind-bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>

<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often place basic abstract questions which are at the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"such a question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilot operated remote-controlled flying machines, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospate, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they glowed brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire Universe."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was emitted into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded into gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell life on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago a group decided to build more courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- a giant laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is now called Advanced Ligo."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically this was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clutter in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and punched in the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers in courses on the Theory of Relativity often perform a properly albernated dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ludicrous, are."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stacked by us when the waves hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties during construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are resourceful, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to say, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: face lifts, the size of your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the case of sounds, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you a lot:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to specific properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob disrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"silky Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make any easy pictures of objects in the universe with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally listen to the All."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott is busy already very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulate simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"when the two bodies rotate very quickly, one hears the same circle with an additional key change. this sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of motion, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo following: [Surrender noise] Someone who knows what to hear, recognizes this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate about as quickly as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves pierce iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">Gravitational-waves should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and that is the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo they observe, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sour noises for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, I removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes" "changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes" "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected item. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"guess, I need milk for my cabling."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on I swear to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a surprising side effect: only recently, I understood completely that the" yes "saga for playing with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things get up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I am making television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days with four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts at the same time: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I must find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you, so that all of you who work so hard whether you are now a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a classroom, take me seriously if I talk about work so that you can understand that I am not just walking around on the computer and fantasiere, and it is true when I say: I don't understand that there's no dream on a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, you have a high sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, if I declare to them the sums, that I'm persuaded that writing is my pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I started to work and work and work, build, create and work, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summa is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you can no longer strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more crowded limits, the more work there is, the more things get me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overloaded, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single employer.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "I'd like to go to Shonda-Land". ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The summing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same titanic work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I simply had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love is suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl, stupid author-Titan." ""</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you're doing it, you're working, you're working, you're working to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that gives one the buzz when you know the sums if you stop the sums, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late, and she says," "Mum, you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things are aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" "estimation." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I am Titan, and my sums are rushing, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mum, you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and nurture their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not right away, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of labour, the title of titanium, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are no force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The Summa is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"real sums are God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't agree on how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a man rather works than being at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we move around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I mostly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can also do it! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you."</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naive for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you have probably right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking my teeny daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am Mother of the Year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no need for more."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes per piece even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at play!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my feel-good, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the sums, to have a place for peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I siege. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not allow for a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sum seems to return when I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sums, the sums are not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work are part of me, but just a part. I am so thankful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I create, the marathon that I run, the troops, the screens, the high clay, the sums, the other, the right sum: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, moving, naked and new feeling of life within me is broad. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am an author. I think things, I raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and to play more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly, they have heard of one of the most known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, you implantiert an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">History started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior doctor and worked in the emergency room day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that the brain oscillates the brain and increases the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life you have to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed to succeed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They are made up of 4% of our cerebral palsy cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so secure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we matured them at the origin of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we mature these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we mature the same cells in weakened brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we matured the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared after a few weeks as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplantiated exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motorized cortex in the motoric Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastity brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we matured the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturing."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implantiate them with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope, that I can soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicentre study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First of all it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable getherness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as finance ministers in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to affect the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are averted, our future blew and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit paradox." ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin-dye.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy economists and corporations, which however are too fearful to invest there where it would be productive and incomes to produce all the things that humanity needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and the euro area, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3,4 trillion US dollars sounds a lot of money until you compare it with the $5,1 trillion dollars, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to crow out the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin tops, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe unemployed, which, like in a final loop, advocate the pessimism of investors, which, like in a final loop, encourage the pessimism of investors, that his son would kill him if he is erased,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances leading to the fact that Oedipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely extravagant kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and naturally slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the athic democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athenical democracy was and is that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighting in matters of the state prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athic democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, as the economy gradually underwent politics and mastered it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it can be in the government today, and yet not in power, because the power of politics is migrated to the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my veins with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a flock of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which they nourished, that they end up being starved at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, political goods are devalued, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twins summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy back together, and it would be better if the" democrats "retains control, just like in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more bearer, and social conflicts more deeply, just as I believe -- will come in countries such as China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratize the re-united area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy that makes the film" "matrix" "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"thus, the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" "matrix" "or something that the company is in" "Star Trek" "in the machines, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "to indulge in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia rather than the "matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derived from capital and redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction is between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees working there, but they do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no raging twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you did not have the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time liberally, in which they preferred privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the Mülleimer of history, and Keynesian, global keynesianism."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we collectively decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a liberal Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... does not we do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am totally untamed."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have told very clearly what you think of the West's view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, if I can say this so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can observe now in China is similar to the evolution we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now that China is proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells huge amounts of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers from Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I warned that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say good-bye to the self-complacency, and the persevering denial that a massive fault line ran through the Eurozone and continues to massively jeopardize the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the eurozone, have also elected the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to get alive through political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed for a while, but when changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead of?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were going through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"it is worse than during the" "Great Depression". ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the troika of the lenders imposed on this policy was: "that was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be bearable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard the most, although he is probably responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelconditioner and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will show your show at nine and above, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to where, after you watched a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the medium output, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't enthuse."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is there, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price no longer want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is out for nothing, it's true?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon was supposed to make Sitcom about four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it slightly different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows, their course they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, what producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the pieces together, they went a car and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"you have two very competitive, data versed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic is somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working so, this is a bit frightening because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company such as Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the bad type, they can predict -- by data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year by year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life - at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions about how the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you dismantle this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the items back together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reset the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is part and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete to then grasp a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn't have been able to do. however, the decision of how to take all of these parts and make a show like" House of Cards, "didn't stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they chose TV ideas, then when they chose" "Alpha House" "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say," "We tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is useful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it's also called" Magic 8 Ball, "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will flick it later with a demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life so far, I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
