Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people are supposed to meet today .
a mine chapel where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is du@@ g .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the erst@@ while foundation of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to date .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this knows everybody who had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but precisely therefore very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a tile carpet which you can &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; for cities and communities , detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheets , were incorporated into the large picture postcard . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian version of survey@@ ing , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originate from the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
&quot; after all , the French troops with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville were removed from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management . &quot;
the documentary sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek website .
the comparison early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was commissioned 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 1877 , in the Munich district . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered pockets from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original photograph &quot; &quot; from which the properties were derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots there are no farmers there today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sonne . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 in the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the territory of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , one reads not only the street names &quot; &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the Lü@@ nen &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ ch &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment of this psychiat@@ rist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he has forbidden the personnel to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , first place was first , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ene anstalt in Haar in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psych@@ i@@ atri@@ ates in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people now meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - in architec@@ tonic reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ene Institution , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; , &quot; the department store called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies ris@@ ked a lot of holes in the inner city in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn station . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil rights group publishes travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to Promot@@ e Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention during travel by the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ en@@ ary incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and are noted here , &quot; &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to win discrimination acc@@ ents , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue travel warnings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that people pass .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor , showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring along ch@@ ew@@ ing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of residential or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view on further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac created a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right grab@@ s of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man CD@@ U association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ th@@ est . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste , only region@@ ales come . &quot;
&quot; as he is also BL@@ HV chairman of Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s bach , he described the &quot; &quot; crossover project &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the gr@@ ass@@ land surface care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ usive operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the significance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
the farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; thus , the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted , one quarter bore the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ men . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmer remained at 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; &quot; here , best foods are produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows government funding of f@@ ences .
the goal is the keeping of the Black Forest .
pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a Förder@@ kul@@ isse mentioned by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be drag@@ ged down ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ bacher ordination project in 2018 . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the cost of calculation is more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Fir@@ dos Platz in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a hot battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to dras@@ tically restrict the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he touched their meaning , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller rec@@ ited A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , / the el@@ usive waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ usive waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America .
&quot; Laz@@ arus - and their friends , who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a classical exemplary image .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself has a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the link of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the significance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty never invites anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who brings the American flame to the re@@ bu@@ ed world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues . &quot;
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something here . &quot;
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative deed of Laz@@ arus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminiscent of a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ re &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; Scotland is developing something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made quite natural were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete with their fifth world champ@@ ionships in the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that &quot; &quot; unbelievable &quot; &quot; is that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminiscent of her first world champ@@ ionships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me , it makes something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on podium . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home@@ support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion again .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the unit of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sw@@ elled at the cri@@ tique , safe . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a repub@@ lican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary He@@ at head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
&quot; he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters , playing his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the block@@ age of the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post was talking to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I kindly commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees marked as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles , or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she announced a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U on account of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck at his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trading and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not put them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led next door to the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry did a great job when he set this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that really feels particularly good , &quot; said the player native to South@@ port . &quot;
I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after winning it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who , after his 50@@ th birthday , returned to the European Senior Tour this year , returns to the promotion on home ground . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad about how it went so far .
&quot; with the trio in the field , the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ eck . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance will belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer through passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases for passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;

house closures prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; are reasonably at the time , &quot; &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot to hide in the underground , which is not stated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is repeatedly ham@@ pered by construction works , represents a major problem for the building tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off switches is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for transit .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately , we were fed by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; said Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Reg@@ ent@@ ment in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is taken out and swal@@ lowed out with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with dec@@ eit@@ ful water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occup@@ ying troops in 1969 . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially group@@ ed into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent portion of Pap@@ ua New Guinea embr@@ aced the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ires and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19.@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrug@@ ated roofs that were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under poverty line and some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort generated a value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth a valued 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a stran@@ gled presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ vian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were rap@@ ed , tort@@ ured and imprisoned in 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal state in the 1970s have been committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we value everything &quot; is in a report from the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ een sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting for it here .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the vern@@ ac@@ ular and Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off@@ ence in their tone and returned later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and defeated the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard hit that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children assembled on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial Jag@@ db@@ arches and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird song im@@ i@@ tier@@ ing - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drive stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TIME that was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ f was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TIME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the Che@@ ap spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; their station because they would be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta the following day .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
Minister of Security Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90@@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; he said . &quot;
Wir@@ anto then took a retreat when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he did not have any plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , which accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such asser@@ tions with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after having buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who responded by firing a warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness how the wounded were delivered here quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a disaster for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ires . &quot;
the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deport@@ ed because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report of Indonesia &apos;s most comfor@@ ting provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six pa@@ zi@@ fish states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Right @-@ Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura jour@@ ne@@ yed on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in the session , but want to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried in an area close to the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents , from the 337 meter high , 79 @-@ storey buildings . &quot;
it is the second fire that gets through the high @-@ rise in just two years that is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with fire alarm and scre@@ aming people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who attacked his name as George , Reuters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 clock local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 resulted in the fact that most of the defects of facing , outer cover for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , in which around 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup single only on two winning positions , breath@@ less not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; this is often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ sentence classics remain the tradition rate . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; after many adjustments , the proposal had already come before the proposal to leave the final on a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the next round .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training programs , etc . and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden objects to the aircraft , finds a survey out &quot;
&quot; a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 per cent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items pass by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore prohibited knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed they were late to have discovered that they were mistakenly sent with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition and explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted by a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was conducted - also noted that younger travellers would rather ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , inten@@ tionally passing by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the company said that there were travelers survey@@ ed throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gled goods were brought about by airport security , and how many had done it inten@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry on safety , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids may take them with or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids that are seized by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought the T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding booking . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k first announced another , less brilliant figure for the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just started . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k adm@@ its : a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders have already been with@@ drawn from 6@@ 3,000 . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 in the United States and 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are present in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to about twelve per cent of all orders can become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are to be put together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available per day . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested production lines without major break @-@ ups with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to greater delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers to run away in flocks . &quot;
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the postpon@@ ement of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more respon@@ sive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
&quot; he did not mention the complaint , which had been raised against his prior position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al . &quot;
it is about a period that ran on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan , and to avoid &quot; interfere in local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was President of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma prior to his appointment , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations , which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the post@@ age regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Employment Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration who committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday night , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then maintained to be indic@@ ted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement struck the date for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through legal proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive description of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said that the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans , who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;

tum@@ ours celebrate 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery @-@ area in tum@@ ours will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors of the 6th Charity Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ours .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique rural jewel . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Würt@@ t@@ ember@@ g@@ ische Ur@@ lig@@ ently : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lings and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document according to the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or pat@@ ron@@ age was right and not the other way round . &quot;
so people also lived there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that is still visible today in the place of tum@@ ours , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are subject to these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval egg @-@ ear@@ thy right .
&quot; a gentle@@ man , who built a church , took place and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this own church . &quot;
&quot; this was the right to use a pastor , or to propose a new pastor to the Bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones of the two were broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were dropped and the ch@@ imes were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops enc@@ amped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ n@@ ants of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary Church was dem@@ ol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half pl@@ ung@@ ed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower @-@ wer@@ g still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em take care of the &quot; &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; &quot; as successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite friends and supporters of tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Combo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
&quot; to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organizers expose the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant which is of significance for tum@@ ours and radio @-@ schwei@@ ler .
&quot; the friends and supporters of Tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med . &quot;
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim does not defend itself &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim compl@@ ains &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind@@ force concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette for a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a mold fault . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval of approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council again decided to re @-@ enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been entered in the district of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express himself with regard to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are territory . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen Stad@@ ler founded the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in death .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car took the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 year old mother . &quot;
city and dealer are planning &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September . &quot;
&quot; the trade @-@ market and municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the inhabitants for shopping in the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the business @-@ market , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies shall present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite the &quot; &quot; midnight stop shop &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action not only targets residents of the city and the region . &quot;
&quot; preparations are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal and commercial sectors cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the commercial sector and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; &quot; Active day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ known Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include cour@@ iers and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
&quot; at the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was time to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly spread , had said the king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , director of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , said that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchase behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , a gas explosion occurred in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them were heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later also born dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a mis@@ fortune , the authorities susp@@ ects work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the holiday , only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump bet after fully @-@ sent tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President seized him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall at the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and unveiled a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia is ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; &quot; de@@ pot &quot; &quot; after having proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and triumph@@ ed at the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , reached the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer strip - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man br@@ anded .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am torn the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one night . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience sounded very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens &apos; rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge came back to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were used by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever indic@@ ted for murder .
&quot; it is truly incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in the organisation of the post office . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the Georgia State and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; for him , the position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court physician puts a sheet on the bodies of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding gra@@ f@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain open for decades , citizens are saying that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election stab@@ bed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she wore was not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they came from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , includes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and sli@@ pped the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral campaign , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has managed the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are then confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in us all , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of Black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene played a well @-@ played overview of the play . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es out and p@@ ushes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , van@@ ishing of my property ! &quot;
Sha@@ cona re@@ fut@@ ed the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least every black actor ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ t@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and precisely because the energy moves in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona speaks the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a sad@@ ness , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays sor@@ row@@ ful Lob@@ speech &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice is breaking every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they all experienced Georgi@@ an oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ eling rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w trans@@ forms Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow players , and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair from Atlanta is talking about the night @-@ position with a black couple that they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; Today is called the only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone holds Broo@@ ks farm at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post is in a certain way inspiring because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo of GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; in front of it , an open Mercedes @-@ Benz is par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ kill@@ ers pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil barrels recall Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ killing actors - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;

brutal the scene when he strikes Siegfried .
later I also have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience ow@@ es it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated in a stor@@ my way . &quot;
&quot; there is a big appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure wear . &quot;
&quot; with excitement , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was expected . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a pi@@ v@@ ot conc@@ erto on himself in 2013 , there were five years later great che@@ ers , in which the occasional &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to be happy .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown up with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I prefer a positive summary .
max amount works as volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
amount : I did Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focus perhaps too , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where to do his FS@@ J .
you can make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was exactly the right thing for me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
&quot; lot : well , here it is not about reck@@ oning st@@ ati@@ sts . &quot;
you always have other people in front of you who have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , a teen@@ ager , has been brought out of the family - you must always deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
&quot; quantity : for this , I am not the type . &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;
Pear@@ son crashes more 3000 jobs and crashes the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced . &quot;
&quot; job reduction , the Director General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for reducing costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it achieved a growth of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed by NATO and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a Nato statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive sentence . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a suicide @-@ car bomb killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ i@@ tic district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is weighing , the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA canc@@ els decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to Kl@@ agen@@ um
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states compl@@ ained the Agency for the step of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to advance the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulation 2015 , &quot; and said that it shows the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June to specify o@@ zone regulations , in which in part of the country , pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air@@ quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 most democratic states , together with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , o@@ zone contains &quot; reduce the lung function and ampli@@ fy respiratory symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipalities wants community space
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : in case of two votes , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln decides to establish a community space in the future retirement community . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will continue until the area belonging to the church is still owned by the church , there is now no planning point for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council are suspended , such a common area is not just as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ tic housing , but openly into the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that , in this respect , one does not want to throw a b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , the finding that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ - and ambient roofs - which reduces the height and construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; unnecessary , so does not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings with which one can &apos;t get so right now , but now you rest in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m working hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give a supplement , but get a real , in case of doubt market@@ able counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to ple@@ ad the proposed proposal accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision in such a way , we make a huge step forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision by car : cyclists will be thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth was captured by a car and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road on the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
one in the same direction driving passenger driver granted him priority .
&quot; when the lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not refer to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he met a car who contributed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown down on the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retreat carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must abst@@ ain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first time in the new season . &quot;
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel will always be increasing at the German football record champion Bayern Munich . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the BV@@ B with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 viewers , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
hiking in the resin from star to star
&quot; in the Harz , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet of planets in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the needs of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , called it . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic achievement . &quot;
the members want to set tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations to five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be complemented by the internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting the location choice . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the star@@ base train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the ast@@ er@@ isk path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which star picture you will find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating at the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , there is something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Path since 2003 on the initiative of the planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary road leads up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ ality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , measuring 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light is needed from Sun to Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
&quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would take half a year . &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , the corridor down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ spring @-@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you going to champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down on lightweight .
and he has to move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must compete with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also had interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and then openly expressed himself to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday fight . &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stayed with the generous compli@@ ment for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow ... I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus .
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show punch strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which arose for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; said Lom@@ ach@@ enko : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and this is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tyre plac@@ er
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was losing control of his vehicle shortly before the connection site . &quot;
&quot; the car drag@@ ged to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the north for about one hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident scene . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , there were not the two oppos@@ ers at the 2 : 2 vs. Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a cl@@ ash , the Fort@@ un@@ as don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better with the three @-@ chain experience , even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just finished in the three @-@ chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we do better harmon@@ ize and do not make so many playback mistakes . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can speak about a mis@@ sung start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
&quot; the start of the season I judge only after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be ab@@ orted pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; she said , and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; says the interior def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the guest from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no squ@@ ad in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age assessment test published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Food Safety Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun testing the tests last year .
&quot; they should take the assessment of age more precisely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration Peri@@ od ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in judging the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration short@@ ened 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged as above 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the investig@@ ator is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investig@@ ates the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , during x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves ass@@ essing the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it surely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is scar@@ cely under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy concrete were installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time at all three ne@@ eding bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the timet@@ able is adher@@ ed to .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a arch @-@ arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning , on Wednesday morning , received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy @-@ called bridge @-@ cap on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; this is a marginal fix@@ ation , which is also used as a run @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that there are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be scr@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the bus@@ h@@ ort in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated one lane by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 Euro . &quot;
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties tend to pull at one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the District Day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows this day peac@@ efully because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites to a &quot; &quot; big campaign &quot; &quot; campaign . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D men , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; the town pic@@ ni@@ cs was originally planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ person of the Forums One World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad &quot; , &quot; which could also eat Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ D volcano Eifel . he stri@@ ves for such an event and will get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes , there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : at 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle Kassel also provides various speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners , who wait for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; for more than one hour , the Af@@ D event lasts , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is to be vac@@ ated shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can back - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets Tr@@ ump@@ et
&quot; a re@@ viewer with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European leading orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combine the desire to not only exceed the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating artistic masterpiece . &quot;
this spring of the programme was premier@@ ed with huge success in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is quite openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally became bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone whom I have given . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten became that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; I didn &apos;t like it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; Girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the public does not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to stay in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some consider me to be un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify it all over the public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today , I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement before the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from doing our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said R@@ onna President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
Russian Athle@@ tics Chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were carved out of gold and silver medals at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot;
the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the Athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and prohi@@ bi@@ tive trainers still work freely , he said repor@@ ters in London after a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral ceremony for the soldiers of Mali
&quot; during a funeral celebration in the North @-@ Hessen Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers were meant for a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; however , they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner &apos;s of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen had died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took their leave . &quot;
&quot; after that the funeral celebration began in the circle of the family , closest friends , by representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the chief inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; grapes laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defense from Ley@@ en described the reverse soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the flying operation of the Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six @-@ formed tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have mo@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show that the deployment was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any statements . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave near his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that divided the king &apos;s house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired to reti@@ re and also lay down the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ahl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark didn &apos;t get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; the Brus@@ hed Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristocr@@ acy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked in the French embassy on the Th@@ ames .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always fled , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik says over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social criticism , I could not hope for follow @-@ up . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swift re @-@ election of the Parliament , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
this was because of the dis@@ solution of the Parliament on Friday .
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from their state @-@ state parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ U fac@@ tion@@ ist Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his Group , to include it . &quot;
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to be scheduled on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament is depri@@ ved of confidence and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be checked legally clean , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all the questions will be discussed if they are legally audi@@ bly audi@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ehr@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but a little curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the dism@@ issed dep@@ u@@ ties to return their land treaty .
&quot; we , of course , assume that they have received their land tag , which they have received via the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extra@@ ordinarily . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot;
&quot; also against the background , that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of the Lower Saxony @-@ Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats leader on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her ven@@ erable vanity and in her fru@@ stration are her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital .
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U fac@@ tion@@ manager Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was then ahead of the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a sk@@ inn@@ y majority of one vote in the country day . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from poison@@ ous eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge exactly and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been un@@ locked immediately and has since become known to Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are transport@@ able and safe for health .
&quot; if at eggs of the resi@@ due level of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current level of knowledge , production plants do not have immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little controllers in the crop . &quot;
is there only a lack of personal or coher@@ ent competence ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which crimes can be present are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made clear that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and transport@@ able food .
&quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as a result , manufacturers , retailers and consumers get caught in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ safe animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it must be worked consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is quickly enlighten@@ ed and un@@ brid@@ led . &quot;
how the financial rules of football have an impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the governing organisation that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar sign and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team through the rich royal family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to counter with legitimate income sources , which enable them to play the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , che@@ ated effectively and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to shrink from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the reporting on the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sum of redemption can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 launched the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs , who could try to list their financial statements by blind@@ ing their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come over payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be amb@@ ass@@ adors and simply be able to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to consider any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different paths or have different interests when a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new gi@@ og@@ gi@@ an supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; now , the close cooperation is in front of a potential end : the airline sign@@ alled the contract . &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged goods of up to 14 grams , each year , distribute the flight attend@@ ants before landing on passengers . &quot;
Swiss News did not want to make any statements about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ der estimates the order volume according to &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a foam manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; how many applicants are involved in the new bid , the Swiss will not be able to reveal . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the Spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a position . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , chocolate tablets are distributed on board their flights since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class with le@@ ak@@ ings will be p@@ am@@ pered by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title def@@ ender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 65,@@ 13 meters , qualified himself for the final fight . &quot;
nostal@@ gia starts in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ years gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd . &quot;
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ tual era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ ff@@ ening themselves to the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle @-@ aged play dirty children who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more to the g@@ casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which is the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point viol@@ ates a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the grac@@ ious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ c@@ tor , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another mad @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , included in the Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt Dill@@ on Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of acci@@ dental del@@ usions that could heat this fran@@ chise like a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as its logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose latest scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminded of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ fight icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized in English . &quot;
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends time to watch chess on TV as Americans may do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Reag@@ an mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it pul@@ ls away and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a smaller length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are constantly visiting the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a nest .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs Maf@@ ia in the country
the police managed a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched for , as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office held Constance on Friday . &quot;
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against this .
&quot; in addition , the officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , two people were arrested at the same time in Italy . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of drug crimin@@ ality , serious violence , temp@@ ted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trade in the South German area . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was an active exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the Grand Master was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly related to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ ls , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
ways complain large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens not to show up &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report commissioned by the Federal Government of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , he drew attention to large gaps in the foreigners &apos; register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mal@@ ign@@ ations in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis given by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded in the Register , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by around 600 foreign nation@@ alities in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not well maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data entries can considerably slow down processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on out@@ going people , moreover , EU citizens are survey@@ ed that would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , such false alleg@@ ations led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with deportation , &quot; &quot; he said in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugees families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is said that BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , except for inf@@ ants and small children - Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper is referring to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first achieve . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with poor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for inclusion and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
other EU countries would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights un@@ lawful conditions for the lack of the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach made the blood donation service available for other people .
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community in the session of the municipal council acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ously how our bodies are laid out for this and we have respect the cal@@ end@@ ars of respect that make their blood available for strangers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Department Head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because cann@@ ed cann@@ ed foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn @-@ makers reported from the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K county manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spent ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when they kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month that weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth prospects for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on fiscal income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
but they sign@@ aled that interest increases were needed over the next few years to increase the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs were likely to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h business cycle , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ etus of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; magnitude than the markets expect . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the bank stressed that &quot; &quot; incre@@ ments &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; incre@@ mentally &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ed rising expectations for interest income and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and minor salary increases , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first even worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; in the coming years , &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision will come one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote which caused the lowering of the spark .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely .
&quot; before the bank &apos;s final judgment on interest rates , the call rose after a rise of interest , since inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to their goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; attributed to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive because the credi@@ tors are looking for business and want to finish the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages shut down , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis pre@@ dispos@@ ed before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can decrease the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by healthcare via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ diction pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for treatment are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in to participate in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is systematically deployed , recorded and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer of NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , aimed at targeted and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , declined from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my former in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally , a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height optimally . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other , so the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the issue . &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked over each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to lay down the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us views over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to let it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; Er@@ fan explains from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is equally important , so if you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter of some standard into something quite astonishing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to quit them . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation with one of the biggest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club , and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis , lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business can be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family in 1973 bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co jeans set up and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has the value of $ 316 million , and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars . &quot;
the division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed attempts . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides . &quot;
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood properties , in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ creen of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to disclose her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million while leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; Paul &quot; has become bit@@ terly bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has been very restra@@ ined even though he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography of the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .

Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a regular course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff at his first working day , he was a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House he wanted to repair : bad information that comes into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media device .
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television last decades back - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; said the former electoral campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets would have even more ignition components without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his collabor@@ ators managed to keep it away from him several times , their efforts were worth it . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump &apos;s con@@ tro@@ ver@@ t .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house , which consists of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that possibly promotes their views of the world . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - quite busy with this story - in May reported about the preference of advis@@ ers to give the president for strategic reasons dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused the President malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
dump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ searched criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for . &quot;
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sword of the sword are not known naturally , references from the population will hope and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; advent calendar from the winter .
&quot; the experiences had shown that many volati@@ le to hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of online accounts have been captured so far , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the base of war that have negotiated a dit@@ ch out of the church to re@@ claim a field in front of their manor houses .
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; Milli@@ on@@ aire series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were kick@@ ed out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch extracted by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defensive installations and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &apos; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening , after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I am living on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my church taxes , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; an inhabit@@ ant who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person by the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep it as fast as possible .
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
Birk@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made of the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof by the Ambiente operating company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 nights were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building offered the hotel building as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the establishment of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a construction plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Council of the Council .
&quot; but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s supre@@ m@@ acy Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site , and already spoke at the time of growing interested people at the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ le@@ containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been torn down , ceilings partly dem@@ ol@@ ished , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should later be &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the not@@ ions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments is needed , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , it pays off . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to foreg@@ round , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace created by the restaurant , which is public , will be accessible . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets out Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the body recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling for a familiar person . &quot;
the paper emphas@@ ised the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ cast@@ ed the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to be targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men should stand who acted as advisor to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the center and investigate whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to check the present evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether it is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the count chambers .
&quot; most of the time , they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge people to the atten@@ de@@ es under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; in the report , people who were involved in the meeting were called to a statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps coun@@ sel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his event@@ ual campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation .
&quot; on Thursday evening in the US television , legal experts said that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russian affairs as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he didn &apos;t know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but these work also usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not to be determined against the President .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigation against former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator and its staff . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent promot@@ er of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators proposed legislation on Thursday , after which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could no longer be dism@@ issed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg is driving in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
&quot; in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tica , a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
he shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the large col@@ os@@ sus to the north over a tril@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometers drive north and will probably need two , three years until it was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the biggest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , according to research information is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; however , for some 30 years , however , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of gl@@ aci@@ ers in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; just north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece is broken down at a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as it float on the water and displ@@ aces ice as much water as it yields after melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e causes that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow straight into the sea and drain much more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a minor degree , writes the British research project to observe Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most common withdrawal since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists is cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sed , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not reverse the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not on climate change , however , in the past few decades , however , many gl@@ aci@@ ers of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen . &quot;
this long stretch of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the Polar area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline in temperature .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus t@@ amed to the areas in which the temperature rises to the fastest .
CD@@ U wants house @-@ tari@@ ff at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U , from the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Union , ur@@ ges to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs have passed in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind . &quot;
the teaching points in the circle are obviously very sought after .
approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places in vain for this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle further lacks staff to handle the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied positions in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel production and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented evaluation of the application . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease @-@ related or age @-@ related reasons , come from the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Volk , leader of the group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long ago caused a big surprise already in the circle of chal@@ k , when he publicly challenged the staff@@ ing costs and aston@@ ished the rest of the parties . &quot;
&quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , allowing a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we are not at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; &quot; so people . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than the tari@@ ff for the public service is actually fores@@ een . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently dict@@ ated , increased or more money is only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees concerned about the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Prot@@ ect Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy ti@@ ghtened the tone to NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue to do so if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked together effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organisation said in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only assess any accus@@ ations being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , monitored since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew will take infl@@ atable boat migrants aboard , which are delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acquisition , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of being over@@ shad@@ owed by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board , who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy had greatly decreased in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have taken fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , of which one could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest saus@@ age market .
&quot; again , the look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; flo@@ wery &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome p@@ auses . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed in the air @-@ inhal@@ atorium healing br@@ ine .
Neustadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporting and cultural . &quot;
console instead of tur@@ f - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of being swe@@ ating over the stadium racing at wind and weather ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages included . &quot;
this also recognized the first federal lig@@ aver@@ ages that are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that there are still several clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified for example . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal particularly with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present in these markets than once a year to send the German government to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in the E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just FIFA World Cup FIFA are on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport , le@@ agues have become established in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it all about a kind of sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to ordinary people . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sp@@ orth@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and many biological and physical reactions which one can also find in the classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the k@@ icks player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ang also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist empha@@ sizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) pres@@ upp@@ oses a rapid growth in the E @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; the German Bundes@@ liga , which is almost 2.4 billion euros , is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte Consul@@ tant . &quot;
internationally there are many countries already .
&quot; great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football club clubs , according to Dut@@ t , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B @-@ Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company with the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only in football everything remains as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter due to the lyrics , which Conrad Roy pul@@ ls for suicide , condem@@ ns &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been subjected to gran@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; Carter was convic@@ ted in June for the casual kill@@ ings of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had been suffering from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally de@@ pl@@ ore .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t b@@ other the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I turned with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will wear for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more to have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit suicide to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew attention to national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hands on , spring from a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is switch to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter looked at the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Carter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced to her British ro@@ ommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; what was different from his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the split stop to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner was afterwards afterwards , after his first use as a Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the one would have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could also suggest Kim@@ mir .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday s existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he . &quot;
sugar is distributed to those with a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in your mood .
&quot; those who have been chosen to take the inheritance of L@@ ahm , can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old acted as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general , Kim@@ i worked in this position as the one who can also take the helm out of the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave orders , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the look for the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
&quot; V@@ idal thus to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fold barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , come out to join the performances of the Asia journey ( fol@@ dable also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le make no negative impact in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
&quot; that , after all , worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bayern world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye to a few sh@@ aky statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the New . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V requests from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously t@@ ad@@ dle the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has blocked all of us . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around is nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is to stand . &quot;
the western circum@@ ference of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country .
&quot; the aim is to take the route into service in December 2020 , says Minister of Minist@@ eri@@ es@@ of Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees this as a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) stri@@ ves , as inspired by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; in the new Master Bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a bonus of 1000 Euro is provided for the master exam and 2,500 euros , if graduates make their own training independently within ten years after master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , at the same time it lacks the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who want to adjust the bis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state mobility , there are only 29 places to date . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; in 2017 and 2018 , CD@@ U fraction Christian Bald@@ auf points to calculations of the invoice , the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads than proposed . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ating internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; ex @-@ econom@@ ist E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become the President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of dis@@ agreement they already cleared the field . &quot;
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; he referred to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - offering or restri@@ c@@ ting diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases to install , also take up what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of boo@@ sting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attempt to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen which were able to regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices , which could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities acc@@ use Audi to have a system installed to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer is di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; with that also the Is@@ ar visitors participate , there is a raft through Munich on the mor@@ row Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building stock wants to clear up .
on the raft one sees a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ger .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be shar@@ pen@@ ed as a protective game of game . &quot;
&quot; during the last summer , the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most widely published carto@@ on@@ ists , the rab@@ ies of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still records and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 60@@ ies in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breaking his breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o pieces tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working daily for almost ten hours daily . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches , his dro@@ l@@ ful figures still find a lot of dis@@ semination worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los of any most popular animal in his drawings - , who has a jack as an opponent . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he is more likely to rely on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced word@@ less . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions transferred to dro@@ ught and because of the disease @-@ transferring insects , which scientists and farmers try to find solutions , causing major head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is highly endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only temp@@ ting for vac@@ ation@@ ers but also for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are taken into account include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent compared to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200@@ th anniversary .

the murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office that were the target of an attack with shells in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a black@@ board at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ r@@ als , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the repor@@ ter to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no peace break from violence , and throughout the country there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a prob@@ ate prosec@@ utor has been established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the mur@@ ders associated with drug traff@@ icking each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are dis@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the where@@ ab@@ outs , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ter River . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot at the streets each day or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug king , who are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt because he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gangs bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for the Nor@@ o@@ ghtest in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the smoking ban problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved it to be able to publish hard @-@ apt studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that is to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel that was like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and run@@ ways , &quot; in order to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones were allowed . days before was announced that spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers , who were not trust@@ worthy of the governor himself . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has printed three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é on the state spending that was concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Public Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of bri@@ ber@@ y cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months before , the readers of Val@@ dez had viewed the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage space for labels and stick@@ ers , prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed some signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der because they have written in organized protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a &quot; &quot; in@@ appropriate society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces stuck with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were positioned next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that the drug trade is scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to sw@@ oop . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ val ri@@ vals and security forces near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ stein@@ kan@@ te they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren hosts nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his mark . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the reporting on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain labor@@ er have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his fl@@ aky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said it would have had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the death @-@ held din@@ osau@@ r , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier that lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has aston@@ ished researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something from the surrounding rocks out of the place , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only blind a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will come into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to move better into its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ our over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ady sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far from the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors have been the chal@@ k period , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish @-@ brown .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on cl@@ ues about his life , including his con@@ served performer to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably far more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ elled through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded flow floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still covers hol@@ lowed arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of maintenance is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it will . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ lowed arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ mour@@ ning .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re long stems - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ mour@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , collap@@ sed . &quot;
there is no information about the exact number of last publishers .
&quot; it is a light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident scene .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of direction Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re long retro@@ fit was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ repor@@ ter reports , it was also on the road to massive im@@ pedi@@ ments - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade noted the signs of the car @-@ ke@@ epers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ ur@@ passed or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
membership @-@ no . K @-@ 07@@ 72 @-@ 86@@ 73
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the cost @-@ effective ticket control .
it is easy to confirm by phone that you take your seat and thereby vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test runs on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes from , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available at the beginning of next year on many other distance routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a rail@@ road speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the name of the rail@@ road de@@ preci@@ ation without the conductor . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; functions so : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the test customers , a button on the electronic de@@ valuation will appear . &quot;
the train attend@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the driver arrives at the ticket control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel without ticket control by our train attend@@ ant , checks in the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , the Marketing Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs .
&quot; who often drives the train , knows that in addition to delays and missed features , ticket inspec@@ tions are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; because often one has , in any case , one of the ro@@ omm@@ ates do not have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you must have .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train attend@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in part or large @-@ room and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other ten@@ si@@ le numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question , &quot; &quot; Let Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to her heart . &quot;
&quot; only one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment who rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the rap@@ pers from the area of St. Louis were killed by Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s empty body that was stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she used her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out , and of a man who claimed , Brow@@ ns &apos;s father , who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can typically name .
at that moment I felt shake ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of people living in the community and filled the streets to ask for answers . &quot;
&quot; as a fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I was lucky to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no lat@@ ent racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel that I would give her a bad service , to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when it arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis as President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; only &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt &apos;s occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his engagement brought the project closer , together with six other locals followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for that is how I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant of the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understand that in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people there must be some vulner@@ ability .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , who , after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Matter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note , that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film due to their identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , though it was at the front front , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much in the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news media in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone missing , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she is cl@@ inging to a chant and she feels obliged to remember this memory since she went on the street three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the Bit Gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while one can say one to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ way ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , as well as the rest of the shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the plot on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be an end . &quot;
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the house@@ wives are always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot;
the small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; however , this should not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is well priced at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , stores in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; a pity , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear again . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmer &apos;s market place during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit @-@ Galerie before selling all the shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to make a real farmers market place instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market hall there is no place thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room at Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she made public diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ former and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident who was convic@@ ted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like a sharp , al@@ beit somewhat intellectual comment , not only for the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been convic@@ ted of identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with whom she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ t and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ re@@ ths who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ seas verdict would transform and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand , was a welcome type of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and stress at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid spl@@ its that he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing challenged with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written in pencil , a jack of Cs and Gs and As . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ urious Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ novel . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , how she emerges from the discipline of the United States , such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ ose bum@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if they were to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ical simul@@ ac@@ ras that conver@@ ge like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea as the movement , which also stuck behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of killing .
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are considered susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
on Monday the arrest warran@@ ts issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stal@@ ks . &quot;
a public warning system published by the Chicago Police Department reads that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27th .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the time of the event , and det@@ ectives investigate the engra@@ vings as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them is now in an assessment and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair that is examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any conceivable way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted it to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
security cameras have been confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t have anything to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the D@@ op@@ ings approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA dop@@ ing sc@@ andal in November 2015 by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the main qu@@ arti@@ ers of the Moscow Organization in July , WA@@ DA CEO Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck at your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , provide specific groups and demographic groups , to provide employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you don &apos;t have to be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , after the financial @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ ully in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; it has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main manager is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , converted Conver@@ cent to more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to pursue the dis@@ comfort of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company employs Conver@@ cent , problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or countries have been hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hips more quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employees commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies knew that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both startups .
&quot; cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just missions . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take measures .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointment can quickly grow and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , the company who has seen too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees ask , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and who you don &apos;t care about , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employees surveys , was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so saver . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in a long run this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose your company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
players who are inscri@@ bed to the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ t mill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise went away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood did practical exercises . &quot;
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he under@@ lining the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which already cleared a protective net behind a gate post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people can hire a room and then set them there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on car park 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with false reports to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors of third parties and display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news . &quot;
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors that may display the results of the fact check out of the original article .
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan aimed at quickly eradi@@ c@@ ating h@@ asser@@ ting post@@ ings as before the elections in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of the third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to l@@ essen false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ years who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it would be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; &quot; To be honest , I have over@@ rated my welcome pit &quot; &quot; ) all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ aping , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last hei@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; said Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kne@@ e Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant revol@@ t began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ ter that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed quite stub@@ born to be able to pay debts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old pupp@@ et hides in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the inaugur@@ ation of the 301 year old pupp@@ et chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; even until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want Nelson Art@@ z to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we do not think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that as Bad Honne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; just a logo and a slogan , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ in @-@ one promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef is a mean five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer &apos;s cor@@ ps . &quot;
so this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the pres@@ idency of the heads of state , the five vice @-@ ministers as well as the Ministers of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs were also part of the discussions . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ number . &quot;
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the n@@ avy were dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the overthrow of the revolution as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan really has a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ scarf ban on soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the big coach in the army and security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan was fired by decree another 73@@ 95 state di@@ ener , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they shared their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan drives forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , a named officer , who was seeking asylum from fear of persecution abroad , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not allow Nato to be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges of the Turkish Army &apos;s readiness to use . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he pre@@ fers to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by the US to change the way citizens from other countries are dealt with Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy benefits , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to upgrade track for race car shuttle
&quot; again , over the past few months over the future of the racing tower has been fought - now it is supposed to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , the trail is scheduled to be built on which the tourist train rides . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race to the long @-@ term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is expected to start in the course this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important link , &quot; said Traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route were estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally approved , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operator are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the program should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the past few months , the course of a pilot operation had been tested , whether the circuit is used by a sufficient number of people in order to re @-@ order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the route is also in parts very shallow .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t get crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , a professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver lots of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can adapt his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is even more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman look progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ messenger robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing like sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is tailored to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step on fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bing a most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy uses a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it is said on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement indicate something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not stick to sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their growing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps out of the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in regards to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not odd or insul@@ ting until they give permission to the free market .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ising women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphical images , the intri@@ cate body and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Spe@@ ak of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a rush @-@ breaking of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all are committed to making our filter bub@@ bles burst .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families to bring together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the repub@@ lican relationship , with which she strug@@ gled for decades for politics , suddenly and completely strange at the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also involves considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dist@@ ressing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer encounter us . &quot;
&quot; there is however an even more fri@@ ghtening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked out ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ousel of the New York park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals turn around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the subject pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big round@@ about in northern London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ousel is still a strange magical experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ years can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to reach her credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al in@@ tru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us will risk his sentence to be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ ul@@ ls of F@@ oods and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; in future , three of the students will go to high school , four at the secondary school . &quot;
school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him smote the eagle , and spread out his wings on a high mountain . &quot;
after that the classes showed three and four in studying Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat , the cylinder bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every quad@@ r@@ ator that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to thank@@ s@@ words to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps back to school pupils , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick @-@ time is over now , declared school teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students very reluc@@ tant after two years , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ liter vessel . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in the process , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
&quot; for the new school year , eight first @-@ packs are already registered . &quot;
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 in Si@@ th@@ onia the police arrested a group of illegal people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Foreign Ministry told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court may impose a fine sentence .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of some 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to anyone concerned .
&quot; if anyway an inspection is due , it will be done within its framework . &quot;
how long will the change@@ over have to be drawn ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this will depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be an appointment .
&quot; what drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but just in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
&quot; so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first R@@ apper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars . &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the ceremony . &quot;
the prize winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows has already announced to ref@@ rain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burden me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear her view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after the former President of John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; among the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will go to R@@ ente next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written off , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is a city @-@ builder . &quot;
and the work always makes him great fun as he convey@@ s in the press conference .
&quot; he tells of varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it amaz@@ es that no application has been fulfilled so far . &quot;
&quot; at the next possible date , the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer . &quot;
this should be - considering the regular periods of notice - still enough time for a revision .
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub@@ e of the administrative authority for the Administr@@ ative Association , the applicant has to prove appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity of the city and the city itself is important , says W@@ acker , who is reported by a good company climate as well as a good atmosphere between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life worth &quot; , &quot; he is sure about the building ministry and his staff . &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz are around .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will strike a be@@ ech with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is a big playground for a city builder . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own farm and gardening , many are able to react flexibly to many . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what fits &quot; if new buildings are approved , the missing city @-@ builder . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything is running over my table . &quot;
he can count on many years of staff in support and coordination : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working with Manfred Scho@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for over 15 years .
&quot; also that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wishes himself : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker should have a completed degree in engineering as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good skills in the areas of building planning and building planning law .
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) subordin@@ ates high and civil engineering , construction supervision , gr@@ ass@@ land matters , administration of urban properties , urban farm with building yard and city center ner@@ ei as well as sub@@ e building rights authority including monument protection . &quot;
bicycles on the lines : southern route closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike from the railway crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the scene , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike rider were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ ni@@ peg kingdom , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators could have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the installation , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the costs for the rail replacement transport , even p@@ ön@@ s of the rail@@ road customers could come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum goes out , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern route could be led without han@@ di@@ cap . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were killed in Friday morning , two of them survey@@ ed the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; meat , dairy products and chocolate may help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; however , a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ae , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss , and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected tend to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found out at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food are not penet@@ rating into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han could toler@@ ate a more toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe which was separately accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome l@@ acked and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they got the L reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria were acting on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. Cru@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han &apos;s by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup kick@@ ed off on Tuesday before the UEF@@ A Super Cup kick@@ ed off as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later be ready .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did not wish yet three further commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority obligations . &quot;
&quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new Tief@@ schlag for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , S &amp; D Prime Minister faced a certain concern before elections with a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only a fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the Elec@@ toral Figh@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House have been monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind . &quot;
there were ra@@ kes .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
five months before the election of the country his red @-@ green coalition therefore lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony @-@ based Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will@@ power .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the German Managing Director and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens on the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ ghs , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ mo@@ t message reaches the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the collapse of the green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot;
it is the temporary cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD provincial feder@@ ations .
and nobody knows what is next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at the time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then also - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the SPD &apos;s defeat brought the SPD into the bar@@ ren , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te held the party smooth . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , comrades in the weeks afterwards the comrades caught up again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just stepped up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived . &quot;
and with him the next depression came .
&quot; mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communications he made pretty much wrong what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
added In@@ quiry values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents in the Con@@ federation of Acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the endeav@@ ours of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , also did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , as they promised to stabili@@ ze the party by Wei@@ l . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite could happen . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the cross @-@ party co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz does not at all .
&quot; at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen presents her own career interests on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person , but has been elected to Parliament by the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxony member continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains about a &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
conveyor belt for local core III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives ST@@ EG Urban Development on Wednesday were in sensation . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , it has been in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art rehabilitation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a remedi@@ ation zone III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how is a remedi@@ ation area now created ?
&quot; one will , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler further , investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role in san@@ itation in the planned area .
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the ST@@ EG represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the Federal State Programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the renovation area would eventually then be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the permit period for the funding period has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; however , until September this year the survey would first be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the restructuring area to fill a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the constitution must be carried out in order to begin with the refurb@@ ishment next year . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each municipality had to carry out preliminary investigations . &quot;
it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic ab@@ norm@@ alities and to decide when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective grounds , there is also a re@@ mark in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to emotions even once again and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it is among other things about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing arch &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , division and inhabitants of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if the building is operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , please note that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new building measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first . &quot;
one cannot reserve any funding fee for later . &quot;
&quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; Center II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or puts himself a micro@@ chip in order to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a n@@ avy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military equipment left to the TIME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to its superi@@ ors , the Deputy Marine Corps for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 15@@ am , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second team would need a return flight .
&quot; during the event , the original flight crew was held during the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight was needed . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event might hurt the appointment .
&quot; a question we presented was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; says the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy Command@@ ant . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to ins@@ ulate government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation when the presidential plane played against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is delighted by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries , which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was part of the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting helicop@@ ters out on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Home base of the Marine Corps air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for refund rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter car . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump was talking to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tri@@ cky task
the top of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga starts at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV at the Tab@@ ellen@@ Third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; in spite of five games still imm@@ ac@@ ulate , the top leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga was given the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
especially on the rear positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , especially the imports from the far north are concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to inserts in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us as always . &quot;
you also need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; if the Fr@@ ench@@ man Fr@@ ench@@ man won &apos;t play the Bundes@@ liga in the Italian Bi@@ ella tournament , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) won the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el yesterday with the Weiß@@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
&quot; he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again be back to the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , not filling someone from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ re . &quot;
how America can harm OM@@ V
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he sat down under the law on Wednesday evening under the law to shar@@ pen the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his power to en@@ act the law , the Congress adopted a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels pushed against the US offensive . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft proposes to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the domestic OM@@ V , together with other European companies , have been involved in the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Area Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved into the center of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet . &quot;
&quot; the bat@@ ches three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed their attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company , &quot; only with more governmental bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type that invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
role backward : the city represents 46 ch@@ ick @-@ aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day @-@ day workshops , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again in its own reg@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked is still in addition to the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task , and delivers freshly cooked ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; in the Kre@@ feld area , the city runs 46 day care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; in the last kit@@ esur@@ fing year , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for about 45 hours of the week are eating at the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour service , if children remain until 2 p.m. &quot;
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service from September 1st : they warm up the delivered meals , supplement them to salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioned the meal individually , give food , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seventy @-@ class facilities - decide on the hourly rate .
&quot; the kitchen assistants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the cell power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen forces - is done in the future by special cleaning staff .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it turned out to be the most economical choice between self @-@ governing and foreign lending for the city , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , &quot; &quot; says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , Chief of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be in the provinces in the provinces . three women en@@ code for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban has published threats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3.6 million voters registered .

men try to eradi@@ cate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police information , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stopped working with friends at Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the phone of the girl . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request and went on with their friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , but which was ab@@ used too long . &quot;
&quot; without loo@@ t , the duo fled . &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB &apos;s concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to verify the long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow by managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is next to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s claim to express &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not promoted . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; families of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman by Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross had received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value our ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff members and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed openly .
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uns@@ afe business climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as production facility fully and completely . if our operations are changing at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar in its persecution , after receiving an offer of £ 189 million in order to dis@@ solve its release clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than doubled the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , while the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen leaves for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would be very useful to the respect of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or at that time false assessment of the events . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doub@@ ted that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; that must be punished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ ouring fire . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on mis@@ use cases , also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the enlighten@@ ment officer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ es , sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it is said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be heavier . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even have positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reli@@ eves his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise up his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became the harder hand gr@@ asp@@ ed when a cathedral spar@@ row did not produce top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you are doing the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself more , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all . &quot;
&quot; just eight pages are dedicated to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside of its sphere of activity .
&quot; one can , at best , repro@@ ach him to get out of it too late or have not taken first indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger described him as &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high level of emotion@@ ality .
&quot; that he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and threw the mu@@ es@@ li on the floor , but also distributed earrings and too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , he has already admitted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; however , his hon@@ orary capacity has to be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one wonders whether it is not with its famili@@ arity and role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just rus@@ hed on him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still eager . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also put any involvement or complic@@ ity in the final report with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clear no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the others , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in the education of sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they do not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral conductor who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen school students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a ques@@ tioning student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had timely insight and could have been able to stop the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... even for really absurd to assume that it is expected to be ... Bu@@ ben more urgent or clearer or more open than in front of their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trusted teachers , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; that in advance the students and / or their environment entrusted to him could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to share with everyone . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
must he live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in coverage everything is mixed and bl@@ ended to a huge mil@@ let from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is an abuse of the report .
&quot; it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir leader of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were sli@@ pped and painted , and were horri@@ fied , all of them took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he only had to face the boys as they were already on the hip @-@ gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the topic &quot; Vor@@ ool &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
&quot; you were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have been taken away . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger rig@@ or@@ ously swal@@ low the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school there will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; even in the light of the danger of negative press release , he received urgent progress . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity had long been banned in Bavaria , too . &quot;
&quot; before that , it happened in a legal gray area , as each of us knows well . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the affected might have exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where the per@@ missible limit had really been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he would have looked at it forever . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the trial was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of that time . &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians speak of the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. , the danger of evaluating past @-@ present moral standards . &quot;
the princess was right there .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was hurt in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls . &quot;
&quot; this is all terrible , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked up . &quot;
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so earrings , and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what image from his Regensburg era has been given to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ? &quot;
the subject of the subject of exam@@ iner also came to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , since the dom@@ es only played a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not even hide that he led there a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t even make a great singer from un@@ ru@@ ly boys and in front of every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he can do anything even just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with how many former dom@@ es still hold contact with him today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ti@@ zing , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he en@@ riches her life and has brought to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a loving respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and which they almost worship . &quot;
&quot; and please , again , clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now , the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , no one would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
