<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is dug.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the erstwhile foundation of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to date.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this knows everybody who had to be exciting, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but precisely therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a tile carpet which you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for cities and communities, detailed maps, so-called Urpositional sheets, were incorporated into the large picture postcard."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian version of surveying, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"after all, the French troops with the peace of Lunéville were removed from 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The documentary sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was commissioned 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, in the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered pockets from the so-called" "original photograph" "from which the properties were derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots there are no farmers there today, but small gardeners of the plant" Land in Sonne. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 in the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the territory of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street names" "on the Gasteig" "or from the hill" "On the Lünen" "- but also in big letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Munich-based district-Irrench" "On the Auer Lüften". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of this psychiatrist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"moreover, he has forbidden the personnel to apply violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, first place was first, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirene anstalt in Haar in 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatriates in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected - in architectonic reference to the original building of the Irene Institution, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "Main Square", "the department store called" "Kaufinger Gasse." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies risked a lot of holes in the inner city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to Promote Farms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri, which will enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention during travel by the state, as a number of questionable, racenary incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and are noted here," "says the group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discrimination accents, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that people pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri General Public Prosecutor, showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring along chewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU's view on further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac created a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right grabs of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherman CDU association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feriengthest."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">"on the table of the Feriengäste, only regionales come."</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fisherman's bach, he described the" "crossover project" "as" "elementary". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland surface care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elusive operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not conduct bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune recognized the significance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares, which cannot be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted, one quarter bore the municipality of Fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmer remained at 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you are doing a really good job, without farmers and housewives. "</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White stood firm:" "here, best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows government funding of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the keeping of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Pre-requisite is the presence of a Förderkulisse mentioned by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be dragged down (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"at the moment, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fisherbacher ordination project in 2018."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the cost of calculation is more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Platz in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hot battle with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to drastically restrict the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he touched their meaning, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller recited Acosta:" "I don't want to go down here to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your idleness, your poor, and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, / the elusive waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elusive waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and their friends, who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a classical exemplary image.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself has a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty never invites anyone but rather an early neo-conservative, who brings the American flame to the rebued world:" Lady Liberty continues. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh came across something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, elusive but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the world championship cadre" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "Scotland is developing something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"your captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh made quite natural were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete with their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that" "unbelievable" "is that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "enormously proud" "on the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to rely on this homesupport and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion again.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the unit of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the papers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he swelled at the critique, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters, playing his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that the blockage of the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasserted people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not bottled, but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I kindly commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor's employees marked as" "concentrated spam attack", "would probably call others" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles, or to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she announced a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU on account of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portos had a similar effect on the internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck at his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trading and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery-area in tumours will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the 6th Charity Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of tumours.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique rural jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Urligently: count Hermann von Sulz sold" the mountain with the parish church to Tumlings and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document according to the certificate, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or patronage was right and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So people also lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf that is still visible today in the place of tumours, the" mountain "the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are subject to these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval egg-earthy right.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman, who built a church, took place and occupied with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"this was the right to use a pastor, or to propose a new pastor to the Bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones of the two were broken at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during World War II in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were dropped and the chimes were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the church tower and half plunged.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim does not defend itself" "sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Councillor."</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim complains" has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette, as at the time in Viersen, only at the city border to Schwalmtal has existed a windforce concentration zone."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had already decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette for a few days earlier, but the district government Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a mold fault."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval of approval is still unlawful and therefore to take back," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council again decided to re-enter the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "at this point, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letters have been entered in the district of Viersen since last week," "said a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes it to the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday didn't want to express himself with regard to the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheim Nette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind turbines."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare territory."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen Stadler founded the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="584">"it is a dirt spot on a history, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the Georgia State and a life-long citizen.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected."</seg>

<seg id="590">"according to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding grafties were suspected in the Lynchprocess."</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one was ever indicted.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain open for decades, citizens are saying that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>

<seg id="599">"as it turns out, Harrison, who has prepared and ordered the killings, includes an FBI report."</seg>
<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the killings, removing evidence and slipped the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks formulates it even more concise.</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the governing organisation that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>

<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can make the money loose, so that Neymar sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the rich royal family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to counter with legitimate income sources, which enable them to play the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, cheated effectively and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our factual era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>

<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have damped rising expectations for interest income and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% to 0.3% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year."</seg>

<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision will come one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the lowering of the spark.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the bank's final judgment on interest rates, the call rose after a rise of interest, since inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households, with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers said:" "in view of the recent downfall of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive because the creditors are looking for business and want to finish the year in a positive way."</seg>

<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) should prescribe 10,000 people controversial HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis predisposed before sexual intercourse (prep), which can decrease the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by healthcare via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prediction prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection-prone areas.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"to those who come for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants are identified to agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt-in to participate in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is systematically deployed, recorded and implemented in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive Officer of NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, aimed at targeted and vulnerable people, offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>

<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation. "</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my former in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally, a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height optimally."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, in order to solve the issue."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to lay down the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius views over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," Erfan explains from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is equally important, so if you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and that help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter of some standard into something quite astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide to quit them."</seg>

<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family in 1973 bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco jeans set up and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father Colin - by Paul described as" "main operator and the dominating personality" "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">"a court file states that this means that Colin has the value of $316 million, and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed attempts."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood properties, in which Colin opened the first Jeanscreen of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says that he started Westco when he was" "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to disclose her property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis group, with Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke 26 million while leaving the company."</seg>

<seg id="1380">Colin has been very restrained even though he was a former AFL member and after a biography of the year 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS to say" "I can really not say much," "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our family name through the dishes," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current conflict," "he said and added that he still hope for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a regular course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff at his first working day, he was a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House he wanted to repair: bad information that comes into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television last decades back - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," said the former electoral campaign Sam Nunberg in February to Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to hold Trumps's Twitter habit was to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying price."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever" "under control", "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have even more ignition components without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his collaborators managed to keep it away from him several times, their efforts were worth it."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controvert.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a white house, which consists of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that possibly promotes their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - quite busy with this story - in May reported about the preference of advisers to give the president for strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he can find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused the President malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be" the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Schikanen, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has sold false accusations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Dump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and document the ump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again with some determined travellers on the base of war that have negotiated a ditch out of the church to reclaim a field in front of their manor houses.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road from Solihull, which is called the" "Millionaire series". ""</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were kicked out in May without being deterred by a ditch extracted by the Council to prevent their seizures."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defensive installations and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry residents have urged the Council of Solihull, who said it 'useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said:" they went there on Monday evening, after they were sent to Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers. "</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"the travelers were there in May, were moved forward and are now back."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"more arrived yesterday evening, probably today more."</seg>
<seg id="1437">"she added:" "the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long instructions to protect their parks."</seg>

<seg id="1444">Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made of the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the Ambiente operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 nights were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in the face of a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district, the hotel building offered the hotel building as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the establishment of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Council of the Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all Freudenstadt's supremacy Julian Osswald defended the hotel site, and already spoke at the time of growing interested people at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction shuttlecontainers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been torn down, ceilings partly demolished, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Until March there is still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should later be" "beautiful" "as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewelry." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"you don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a higher downtown level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause he already led, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"after the amount of investments is needed, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to specify exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, it pays off."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to foreground, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, a large terrace created by the restaurant, which is public, will be accessible."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets out Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the body recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling for a familiar person."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper emphasised the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcasted the first invitations of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between the Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence services accuse the Kremlin for a long time to be targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between the Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men should stand who acted as advisor to the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote several weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump has personally moved into the center and investigate whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to check the present evidence in possible interruptions and decide whether it is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge people to the attendees under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN transmitter, pre-invitations were already issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"in the report, people who were involved in the meeting were called to a statement."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. there were also Trumps counselors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his eventual campaign manager Paul Manafort during the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening in the US television, legal experts said that the suspension shows that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the suspension of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russian affairs as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic give the democrats a way to" "feel good" "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he didn't know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but these work also usually in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not to be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump had become loud, he did not want to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June of a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up the investigation against former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and its staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent promoter of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators proposed legislation on Thursday, after which the Special Investigator could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg is driving in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">He shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the large colossus to the north over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers drive north and will probably need two, three years until it was melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the biggest ice-giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, according to research information is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, for some 30 years, however, there has been a series of unusual interruptions of glaciers in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by great glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"just north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abort was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete horseshoe is broken there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece is broken down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as it float on the water and displaces ice as much water as it yields after melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the horseshoe causes that the glaciers can flow straight into the sea and drain much more quickly than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only in a minor degree, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest horseshoe of Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most common withdrawal since the beginning of records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists is contested whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly collapsed, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not reverse the demolition of this gigantic iceberg not on climate change, however, in the past few decades, however, many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long stretch of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey, the Polar area of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline has contributed to the decline in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus tamed to the areas in which the temperature rises to the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants house-tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU, from the Employers' Union, urges to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs have passed in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees have their first working day behind."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching points in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places in vain for this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle further lacks staff to handle the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the circle of Mettmann."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">"the CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and UWG, and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for personnel production and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented evaluation of the application."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside, to show concrete measures for cross-entry and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, a high number of employees, the disease-related or age-related reasons, come from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"thus, the highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Volk, leader of the group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he had long ago caused a big surprise already in the circle of chalk, when he publicly challenged the staffing costs and astonished the rest of the parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all possibilities to be checked, allowing a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we are not at short notice to a satisfactory solution, the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - a Haustarif," "so people."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than the tariff for the public service is actually foreseen."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"salaries are currently dictated, increased or more money is only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in which employees concerned about the provisions of the new Prostitution Protect Act."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirector Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little personnel."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightened the tone to NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs who use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue to do so if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had worked together effectively with traffickers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation since one year, refused to express itself to detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organisation said in an opinion on social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only assess any accusations being raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had the boat from 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, monitored since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew will take inflatable boat migrants aboard, which are delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acquisition, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of being overshadowed by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board, who supervises their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any" significant changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize laureate organization doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy had greatly decreased in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have taken fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Biker, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz, for four days to enjoy trials and sights."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, of which one could see far beyond the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, the lookout point at the lookout point, connected by" "flowery" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters were announced."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome pauses."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the air-inhalatorium healing brine.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporting and cultural."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of turf - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of being sweating over the stadium racing at wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long been a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This also recognized the first federal ligaverages that are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "that there are still several clubs on this train."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organized the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified for example."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football must deal particularly with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future," "says the 52-year-old."</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present in these markets than once a year to send the German government to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in the E-Sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or just FIFA World Cup FIFA are on competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"long ago, as in normal sport, leagues have become established in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and many biological and physical reactions which one can also find in the classic sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the kicks player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Frobang also sees problems:" doping becomes more and more a topic. ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) presupposes a rapid growth in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly about advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"the German Bundesliga, which is almost 2.4 billion euros, is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte Consultant. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">Internationally there are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US Team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood Actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition Unicrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot in Europe too.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the football club clubs, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an e-sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," says VfB-Executive Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is about keeping the tradition of the association, but at the same time align the company with the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digital world," "says Dutt."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"you can't stick to it, that only in football everything remains as it always was."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been subjected to granting."</seg>

<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had been suffering from a psychological illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes, when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>

<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has shown no remorse." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that they totally deplore.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I don't bother the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I turned with everything. I try, in spite of all my pain, which we will wear for eternity with us to be there for his sisters," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was" "persecuted by the knowledge" "that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no more to have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit suicide to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew attention to national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hands on, spring from a building, create yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the eyes of his suicide, she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you need to do is switch to the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter looked at the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"among the few who defended Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is to stand."</seg>
<seg id="1732">The western circumference of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to take the route into service in December 2020, says Minister of Ministeriesof Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>

<seg id="1781">"in the first years as an artist, he worked as a draftsman for congratulation cards - which frustrated him."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once. "</seg>

<seg id="1796">"it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the lavender is declining because of the conditions transferred to drought and because of the disease-transferring insects, which scientists and farmers try to find solutions, causing major headaches."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is highly endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn. "</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicade, a micro-bacterium that transmits the Zwergzikaden, and with very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only tempting for vacationers but also for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office that were the target of an attack with shells in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, Neutrals, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no peace break from violence, and throughout the country there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a probate prosecutor has been established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the murders associated with drug trafficking each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are discomforting and although the terrain is now even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the whereabouts, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelter River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot at the streets each day or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug king, who are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" "peace" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt because he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangs bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for the Noroghtest in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the smoking ban problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenue."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to be able to publish hard-apt studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for her reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that is to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the spaßvogel that was like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love for routine his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and runways," in order to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones were allowed. days before was announced that spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers, who were not trustworthy of the governor himself."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has printed three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on the state spending that was concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Public Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of bribery cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months before, the readers of Valdez had viewed the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been dedicated to the storage space for labels and stickers, protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they have never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder because they have written in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked that she is re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a" "inappropriate society". ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces stuck with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were positioned next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue how El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title" What do you want of us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade is scared."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to swoop."</seg>

<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his mark."</seg>

<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something from the surrounding rocks out of the place, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earth."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blind a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will come into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a parachuting technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to move better into its surroundings and to evade its enemies, experts say that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armour over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shady shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the contershading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is far from the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points out that the dinosaurs was hunted by eating meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the contershading - think of roe deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators have been the chalk period," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including his conserved performer to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea where he sank on the back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably far more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swelled through the western Canada until a flooded flow flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautreste still covers hollowed armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is as rare as a win in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it will."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin still cover the hollowed armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are stretched upward."</seg>

<seg id="2024">"confused, since no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rappers from the area of St. Louis were killed by Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's empty body that was stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," "Ferrell thought."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She used her mobile phone to return to Tweets on Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people crying out, and of a man who claimed, Browns's father, who wore a shield with the inscription:" Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman assured his gun and cried," "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can typically name.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shake chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the sight of people living in the community and filled the streets to ask for answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"now we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them away," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only to know activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I was lucky to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no latent racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel that I would give her a bad service, to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when it arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis as President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "only" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt's occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his engagement brought the project closer, together with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for that is how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrells life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understand that in this work and in the humanisation of black people there must be some vulnerability.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, who, after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin, have shaped the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," "said Ferrell," "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note, that" the movement is really held by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to their identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, though it was at the front front, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much in the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news media in Ferguson have long gone missing, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she is clinging to a chant and she feels obliged to remember this memory since she went on the street three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the Bit Gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" Volksfreund Bitburg, "the topic is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while one can say one to the bit-gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalway! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, as well as the rest of the shops benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the plot on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer's market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the housewives are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also this."</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is well priced at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, stores in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies, as the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmer's market place during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the Gespenst Bit-Galerie before selling all the shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to make a real farmers market place instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall there is no place thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room at Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst banned a 35-year prison sentence after she made public diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks's website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and groundbreaking dissident who was convicted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning and created out of 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment, not only for the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been convicted of identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with whom she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal Brieffreths who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a Comic" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President Chelseas verdict would transform and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand, was a welcome type of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and stress at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid splits that he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning challenged with her oversized signature (the" i "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil, a jack of Cs and Gs and As."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, how she emerges from the discipline of the United States, such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they make your speech cold, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goose bumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if they were to do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomical simulacras that converge like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also goal-oriented, like everything in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea as the movement, which also stuck behind their liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University because of killing.</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are considered suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday the arrest warrants issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stalks."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A public warning system published by the Chicago Police Department reads that the corpse was discovered on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the time of the event, and detectives investigate the engravings as murder, while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now in an assessment and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal affair that is examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any conceivable way.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and wanted it to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he demands the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said, it was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27th."</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras have been confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>

<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the Dopings approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations. "</seg>

<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded from the WADA doping scandal in November 2015 by the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England" spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Handiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg. "</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double-agent in the 1700-years who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heibin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knee Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>

<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are interconnected? "</seg>

<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who allegedly participated in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the overthrow of the revolution as a" gift of God, "because he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces."</seg>

<seg id="2353">"in the General Staff, there are concerns about an increasing" Islamization "of the army which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the headscarf ban on soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the big coach in the army and security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in the middle of July, Erdogan was fired by decree another 7395 state diener, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly considered the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they shared their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan drives forward an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the" Vocal Europe "magazine, a named officer, who was seeking asylum from fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army will be" full of extremists and Salafists in a few years. ""</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't get crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver lots of them, and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adapt his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford-woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the Realmessenger robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing like shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is tailored to your personality as well as possible," "enthuses True Companion's website."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, disturbing a most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy uses a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "it is said on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not stick to sex robots, and while the FRR notices their growing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what seeps out of the marginal zones can be very instructive in regards to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not odd or insulting until they give permission to the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has been praising women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphical images, the intricate body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "the robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Speak of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a rush-breaking of the Trump-era that political divisions, which have polarized the US electorate, also split families in small format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all are committed to making our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticed is the power of Trumps, families to bring together."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship, with which she struggled for decades for politics, suddenly and completely strange at the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this also involves considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left has been strengthened by Trump, but the distressing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and" "trump", "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer encounter us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is however an even more frightening long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked out) - both compared to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York park department, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>

<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it amazes that no application has been fulfilled so far."</seg>
<seg id="2541">"at the next possible date, the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer."</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be - considering the regular periods of notice - still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach acts as a sube of the administrative authority for the Administrative Association, the applicant has to prove appropriate degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would not be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity of the city and the city itself is important, says Wacker, who is reported by a good company climate as well as a good atmosphere between authority and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated to look back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city life worth", "he is sure about the building ministry and his staff."</seg>

<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is a big playground for a city builder."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslachs's own farm and gardening, many are able to react flexibly to many."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have an eye on what fits" if new buildings are approved, the missing city-builder. "</seg>

<seg id="2561">"also that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes himself:" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good company climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who want to bury Roland Wacker should have a completed degree in engineering as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good skills in the areas of building planning and building planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2579">"meat, dairy products and chocolate may help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulae, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected tend to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found out at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food are not penetrating into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance conducive immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan could tolerate a more tolerant, less flammable bowel milieus if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe which was separately accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome lacked and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they got the L reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria were acting on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. Cruteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan's by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military equipment left to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House's military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to its superiors, the Deputy Marine Corps for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17th at 15am, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second team would need a return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"during the event, the original flight crew was held during the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the recordings provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight was needed."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event might hurt the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we presented was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," says the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are closed," "answered the Deputy Commandant."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to insulate government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>

<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation when the presidential plane played against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is delighted by the show" Made in America "- the products from all 50 countries, which are manufactured by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to suspend U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event was part of the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopters also flew 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting helicopters out on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per flight."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Home base of the Marine Corps air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is most misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but consider the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at this time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America," Spicer said. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize that."</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement," We are the Church, "declared by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would be very useful to the respect of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or at that time false assessment of the events."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral-cats with" two measures. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubted that it is" shameful and shameful acts, "that must be punished and prevented in the future; but the" degree of media manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go to the church and this is a devouring fire."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "punches were a quite normal pedagogical means" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on misuse cases, also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the" "My Brother of the Pope" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the enlightenment officer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 domes, sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it is said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be heavier."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to many other defendants, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even have positive memories with him in many cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violence of Violence of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise up his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became the harder hand grasped when a cathedral sparrow did not produce top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you are doing the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more, why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"just eight pages are dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">Non-violence at the preschool also took place outside of its sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"one can, at best, reproach him to get out of it too late or have not taken first indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"in this way, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger described him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding "as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high level of emotionality.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only kneel with chairs and threw the muesli on the floor, but also distributed earrings and too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he has already admitted, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, his honorary capacity has to be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, this is certainly Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"as a result, one wonders whether it is not with its familiarity and role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just rushed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also put any involvement or complicity in the final report with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clear no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," "said one of the others," "It was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in the education of sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral conductor who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen school students rate Ratzinger's role in regard to abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioning student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had timely insight and could have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... even for really absurd to assume that it is expected to be... Buben more urgent or clearer or more open than in front of their parents, dormitory managers, trusted teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - thinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with a clear result:" that in advance the students and / or their environment entrusted to him could not be confirmed as part of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to share with everyone."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "nonviolence" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "seeing" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in coverage everything is mixed and blended to a huge millet from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is cleanly separated: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were slipped and painted, and were horrified, all of them took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to have prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he only had to face the boys as they were already on the hip-gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the topic" Vorool "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"you were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "paradise" "conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so at the most, the accusation remains to have been taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger rigorously swallow the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," "that in the pre-school there will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in the light of the danger of negative press release, he received urgent progress."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity had long been banned in Bavaria, too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it happened in a legal gray area, as each of us knows well."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where the affected might have exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he would have looked at it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the trial was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the" "pitfalls of anachronism", "i.e., the danger of evaluating past-present moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was hurt in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all terrible, and I'm glad that it will finally be worked up."</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so earrings, and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he has also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image from his Regensburg era has been given to Georg Ratzinger, because in the conversations with you for the book" My Brother of the Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">The subject of the subject of examiner also came to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the domes only played a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not even hide that he led there a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, you don't even make a great singer from unruly boys and in front of every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and heartfelt people, of whom you can't imagine that he can do anything even just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with how many former domes still hold contact with him today, 23 years after his emeritizing, visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he enriches her life and has brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a loving respectful person, to which they still look up today and which they almost worship."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again, clearly: all that you reproach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
