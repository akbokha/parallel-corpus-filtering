Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood Star in an interview is now un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear .
&quot; I always get stuck in drawers or sti@@ cked on the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ ff . &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current cosm@@ opol@@ itan .
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , vor@@ m TV with loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the white draft , they ask the question of the wish of children : &quot; we must not be married or have children in order to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood Star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues , looked for a little di@@ version with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
&quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; golden Sports Pyram@@ id &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their celebration , they hun@@ ted in the fast gal@@ lop home to the feeding trou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this speed , I am afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever was - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he let his family run over the anne@@ x of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not even catch himself for photography . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German Sp@@ orth@@ ilfe handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
there is no lack of awards to the sympath@@ etic sport@@ sman .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ tal Lau@@ rel leaf , champion @-@ tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen sw@@ elled him .
long is the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the Sports Pyram@@ id .
&quot; in Aachen , on Saturday , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the double award winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen SPOR@@ TS &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ dder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ dder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sporting legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade deal - that is what Clinton and Tr@@ ump want .
&quot; the two US presidential candidates , however , are un@@ divided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; in case of doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt small and warns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wanted tax@@ ing the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it would be quite different , claimed Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will make a massive return to regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in which to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there could still be partial @-@ party discussions . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants , and re @-@ establish coal mining in the United States . &quot;
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement aims to termin@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand renewable energies with their investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but just protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , ask Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of US $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ ink , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics bew@@ are that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing themselves almost everyday .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women sit .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tabl@@ etop .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ avi@@ lions .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has opened up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the flight out@@ weigh : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ orary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; for example , that tu@@ g for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is no rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , Ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this means that approximately 90 per cent of women living in the housing in the North of Munich are traum@@ ati@@ sed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; because they often don &apos;t help themselves , I need more accommodations just for them , ur@@ ges B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some say no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in housing of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Francon@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it may become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much as the women feel this need of protection , one can read the urge to give it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has been saying that there are us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily get a second house .
assistant Denti@@ sts : demands for new employment campaigns
representatives of the Assi@@ stance Physi@@ cians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns against their disputes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC insi@@ sted that ministers had failed to respond to concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently cal@@ m@@ ly &quot; &quot; had problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requested official re@@ negotiations to all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour campaigns that begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance specialists in this year were fighting six times , the first total failure in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the Head of the B@@ MA Assi@@ stance Physi@@ cians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by B@@ MA .
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions , which still took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture which ended up a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands , and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated ball@@ room of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile had a dirty effect , and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even further improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there was never something bad . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was ev@@ acu@@ ated .
Putin shared and acc@@ using Ankara to fall back to Russia .
the off@@ ence was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the v@@ int@@ ment becomes difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received an ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to win a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; first of all , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he has been enth@@ ron@@ ed almost his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late imperial rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West since its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power was considered a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the persistent anger about the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ ous to draw advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regimes . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this brilliant palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as an analy@@ st once described me , &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel poor@@ ly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents on the press conference said they would not even have stri@@ ped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey den@@ ounced it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State would at least speak with one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Officer , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; the Bank has since dis@@ soci@@ ated itself since then , when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists have used R@@ BS to protect other end @-@ consumer goods . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she decided to focus on more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange of stock exchange to Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue any global goals , but also local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of directors . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ fixed date &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he set on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in flat races . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ee when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacle racing - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career track &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m , and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , only a few before him . &quot;
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma inspir@@ es fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already gained 6,000 gains if he was not just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden for almost 30 years , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form . &quot;
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50.@@ ten years of life .
Russia &apos;s Putin mo@@ ist Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly dism@@ issed Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est trust cir@@ cus .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that without stating reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential office . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in Tallinn &apos;s Est@@ onian capital , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the Chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state in terms of bills of law and controls , to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convincing the smiling faces ?
this step made Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the narrow@@ est trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he did for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff would come back on their own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
that doesn &apos;t know anyone at this time .
but the official claim - that a man who was once promoted as a potential president once upon a time to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister . &quot;
&quot; he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as former member of the State Security Service , K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin reached power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would viol@@ ate the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he was re @-@ elected three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical debate on the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
&quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced its termination in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; on the set , there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement . &quot;
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details of how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be released at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 year old , who previously played in sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love criminal min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible now . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot;
the planned radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth relay is scheduled on 28 September .
puzzles to fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act around Sand@@ als , mir@@ r@@ ored by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; ceiling fans , &quot; which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 s@@ lashes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of all the bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last section of the deck get a concrete for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ end construction and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the north tower on the north side , we had to close the existing gap on the north or south side . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , tiny - on each side they only ru@@ ined a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI ambul@@ ance station hit on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties in swimming while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and placed us the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bu@@ o@@ ing hanging without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived aboard the shore rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had an emergency stop , but this sol@@ dered the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone today knew about these men .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ licensed perpetr@@ ators cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police arrested the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed then his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companion .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old beg@@ ged his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building Braunschwei@@ gs advantageous apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be put into duty in the future .
how do you react to bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 low @-@ priced apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; Housing Concept &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing until now .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be considered social housing in future . &quot;
&quot; however , the low @-@ priced apartments can also be built in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the housing as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions of costs and is still to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , thus Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder runs for investors .
&quot; despite this , as Brat@@ mann , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the program is not yet complete , because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how is the loss of more than 1300 favorable apartments , whose funding will run out over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 homes . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the planning oli@@ tical spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of getting the apartments back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
&quot; for in the west city , the year @-@ end dates back to the end of the year . &quot;
some 1800 apartments could be accommod@@ ated there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city increases dramatically , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called interference . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a large majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
this has focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that there is still a compromise to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on the TV , then limited to video games and finally on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena in pop culture , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der , and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players with their smartphones are going outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that can be followed by a GPS , and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5,000 users recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take 30 minutes to get &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; being active each day &quot; &quot; ble@@ w on de@@ af ears , because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look el@@ usive . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; whoever drives sports regularly , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt for new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also my@@ stic game @-@ spo@@ ilers , which must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has proved to be a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , gr@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bal@@ es is on all that immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast was on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and increased the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team adin A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women of Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the Swedish bar during the solo multi @-@ campaign portrait of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ competition title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world champ@@ ions - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected them to be a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much going between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American female Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace , after winning gold and silver in the sole multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell party the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted that during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a training flight into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ afa was easily led by two turns , the picture ble@@ w . &quot;
floating beams and floor ur@@ ns - in which frame holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she again got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embr@@ aced her sof@@ tly as she expected her final result - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man &apos;s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she threw into the audience K@@ us@@ sh@@ ofen , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;

police : 3 victims shot in the car in serial killer cases
&quot; according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a trip , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police reported that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y of rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ person by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by the investig@@ ators to see a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
&quot; overall , seven people were killed in nine attacks within four months and two more wounded . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown sil@@ houette from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which went up half an hour before the murder of a pick@@ up truck and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his contemp@@ or@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it . &quot;
I am not able to do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself down on that .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband have been told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize her under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help of help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ ling until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has thought of &quot; &quot; Please sing something before &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language to him , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is reminiscent of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I have been asking for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on Friday the emergency . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds following extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards agreed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were growing . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service indicated that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in the rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while mobile was still raining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record level over the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that an up@@ stream in@@ undation in the Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &apos;s state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest stand on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still hat@@ ched people from floo@@ d@@ water in the suburbs of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly over night . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we were awake and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years , where she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood was &quot; &quot; spreading rapidly &quot; &quot; since there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities are considering ev@@ ac@@ uation directions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer badge near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was largely su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities admitted that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and instruc@@ tional crew in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ated in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa destroyed 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were now both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emer@@ gen@@ cies were established to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood , and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses should be reported on Thursday as floo@@ ded , but on Friday they were not reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents agreed that Brown suffered several gun@@ shot injuries , including in the l@@ ende , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at the hospital in his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was en@@ chan@@ ted by bul@@ lets , &quot; said his grandmother Dol@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether it could be among the injured men of the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between multiple sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuous struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were sockets . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters involved , who were very active , &quot; said police @-@ p@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no fixed record , and the police currently reviews the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ club on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
it reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that &apos;s what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , who is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under the female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas has celebrated a surprising Olympic winner and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they did unexpected but master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but it does not look like gymn@@ as@@ tics across the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but reality looks like Tur@@ ning is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnis@@ hing , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these sports clubs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the churches au@@ n my@@ riad , young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more accessible and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
&quot; during my events , we offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urb@@ ane adolescents ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this true depic@@ tion of Girl Power . &quot;
&quot; assistants want to organize more strikes , after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal &quot;
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assistants who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to impose the treaty for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care at idle times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assi@@ stance Physi@@ cians , announced last night in a communication with &quot; &quot; Assi@@ stance &quot; &quot; to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and plan to deal with all the doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes caused by discussions with the government to engage in opposition and sometimes to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; it happened in a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistance physicians .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out more employment campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing doctors at the strike post @-@ chain cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA aims to provide a better week of week for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , urged the assistance physicians to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working combat measures achieve nothing but little , but already burden over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worried , need and break . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the comm@@ ot@@ ee of the assistants and responded positively to the concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the adher@@ ence to agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart rate risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Regul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffers a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
&quot; when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots loos@@ ens , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the inau@@ g@@ ural draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes with people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness bl@@ oss@@ oms in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud is know@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities like a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , former cabinet member , attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an Ant@@ arc@@ tic King , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cab@@ ines to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should be able to prove their identity , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes not to apply removable ink on the finger of a person if they release their vote , in order to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is aimed not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial investments that are accompanied by this , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in East London .
&quot; last year , a special electoral court ruled that the reig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ on should be reli@@ eved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry after a lit@@ any . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding views to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or mund@@ ane background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists deal with let@@ ter@@ dial documents to stop &quot; &quot; election harv@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral campaign being used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
&quot; systematic review of the nationality of a person , in order to ensure that they are eligible . &quot;
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists deal with full postal stat@@ s and envel@@ opes of letter sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set off barriers to voting stations .
a change of law that made an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Economics Act 1983 ) .
photographer prohibition in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally asser@@ t that voters go to the cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was ple@@ aded guilty to the stringent requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check @-@ out checks &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the Town Hall . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the judgment board in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents bears a proud legacy , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come across the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of margin and tape , which turned out to be an impressive double end in the Duke of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ic@@ in is by far not the only one to have gold @-@ fighting ath@@ lete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if one can give faith to the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the wheel course , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain sheet of sheet of the twin @-@ pro@@ mi can be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see a great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should go through as a double @-@ native for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a gear higher : this user is the opinion that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ al@@ lion Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to an athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also liked the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese Flo@@ at has died as a pig

&quot; the Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ in &quot; &quot; as low down &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ est@@ amp staff@@ el gave his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought to the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; &quot; paint &quot; &quot; one could say : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went like a pig , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swim squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to unlock the gap to China . &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was fast and hard at which many of them presented him
&quot; Twitter users did not get back when they heard , how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like rac@@ ists . # tim@@ ed .
&quot; shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC program , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the end over 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ t via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we regret it sincer@@ ely that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers for the show and our followers in the social media yesterday night .
&quot; in order to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wor@@ ding wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Flo@@ staff@@ staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olympic program , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have focused on the performance of the float , not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed by woman who tried sham@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to see , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back to the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled off her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she simply stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she did nothing , and went out and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone who had observed someone - or think about the person who could buy the under@@ pants that she had tried .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take shelter with home , which had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull out clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had an@@ ted them and removed them again and they were not washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products that come in question have been with@@ drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you get closer to you from the back then you should turn first , so you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the att@@ acker squee@@ zes before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run to the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist them , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it &apos;s saf@@ est to over@@ ride your money if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and thro@@ ws a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ stain@@ ed his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rin@@ se knob of a tow@@ ed toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going on . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to le@@ ak the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a tow@@ ing toilet , which has been used by thousands of others may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world , and ate strange things as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely among a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he got up to his reputation in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample stro@@ kes showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; he says in the film : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst , which I smoked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
&quot; I &apos;m not going to lick anything here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Inves@@ tig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the directing of the film , added : &quot; let me say this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had read some of the things I ordered him to lick , just like the ec@@ el@@ usive Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to teach Ian to lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of respon@@ dents of l@@ actic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of g@@ astro@@ intestinal and intest@@ ines and 58 per cent said they have at least occasionally use products that contain attached l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys before del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , the property &apos;s employees shocked the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; walls showed cl@@ inging holes , wooden boards were torn down , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house@@ keeping at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ fe and escape . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , was an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be inv@@ oked the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Housing Del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner for@@ ci@@ bly by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They sat down for no one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family would have failed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called in regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the church building , garbage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and her family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously responded to us and have given us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will give con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours , and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ oc@@ ation on the ground
workers of house management will now have to fo@@ b garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after having found guilty of the possession of a class B drug .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a grave of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 during a car accident . &quot;
&quot; having been without a shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were coated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they are del@@ og@@ ging rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row from De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police reported that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall &apos;s police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after a ti@@ ghtly military jet over@@ flies the beach
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ es@@ ic P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces put an unbelievable crash
&quot; air force forces announced that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk . &quot;
this was the moment when fri@@ ghtened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ pping jet over@@ comes across a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew near over the sun beds on the beach section of Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up as they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle drives , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers , posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ yo added : &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me .
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to the bad visibility there flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , however , the air strikes persist@@ ently har@@ med the security at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , four of which came to death on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke , which limits his view . &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new soccer season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans join the Spanish Super@@ cup for the Spanish Super@@ cup down against FC Sevilla , the bac@@ kl@@ ash increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the dou@@ ble@@ winner must abst@@ ain from eating with the hidden cup@@ fin@@ alists and reig@@ ning Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter is missing .
&quot; the German suffered from a change in the knee in the training , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s demand was clari@@ fied at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been playing the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
&quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique ren@@ ounced a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other applications will take preced@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is a doubt about the fitness state of the team that was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced at the 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sevilla once again has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this application . &quot;
MA Long in its own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the world rank@@ ings first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to get into the final game as expected and made the title to each other .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ onn@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches . &quot;
they pulled themselves back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ ests alone in fair competition alone .
&quot; I have played the matches until here for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang was said to be logical . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ expect@@ edly .
MA had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
through the superi@@ ority of Ma developed not the anticipated stir@@ ring match .
&quot; nevertheless , however , sufficient breath changes were to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for Bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white rus@@ hing had moved to a ri@@ b injury , after that he was in a medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) were , inci@@ dentally , in a similar high table tennis player Olympia V@@ oted . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ its ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now released weaknesses of his election campaign in the former repub@@ lican high castle Utah .
a rare moment in which the normally large @-@ track and self @-@ confident multi @-@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed such a thing as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having cast 16 ri@@ vals within the own repub@@ lican camp , there are now doubts about his success in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians asking for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt is false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
repub@@ lican high @-@ bur@@ gers w@@ ag
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the march of Clin@@ tons again : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him for political correctness , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened to strike funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for Congress are att@@ acking more strongly than the arms . &quot;
Olympics : Tri@@ ster Sc@@ am at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C aims to establish a disciplinary mission .
Ken@@ yan &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Un@@ ge@@ mach .
&quot; following a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee advis@@ es to immediately set up a disciplinary mission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leader Ken@@ ias by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to rig@@ or@@ ously meet their own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ person announced . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , released and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has become World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Mission leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending d@@ oping tests against cash payments of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
&quot; in the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing violations . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of more than 2,000 dop@@ ing targets presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it has been noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; before the summer Olympics in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that D@@ oping means are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports em@@ bank@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
it could be proven that in this type of sport was widespread and systematic thought .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer Olympics .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she reminds herself of melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as Roman &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the West Side Story : &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girl who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family had heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the stron@@ gh@@ old of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it , to go into a war zone - people to ever stop this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from East London asc@@ ended to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she has married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became wi@@ dow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an electoral victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge on the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also noted Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants N@@ ude Calendar for &quot; Women and for Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Belle@@ mere to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we must return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classic nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish the cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term with some hundred thousand protection seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already dra@@ fted Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds before months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the put@@ sch , even secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees in its own country has produced refugees , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the reis@@ su@@ e to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; he said that the German government was &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is taking place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
for the first time I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len followers destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ele , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ immediate Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum benef@@ ici@@ aries in Germany because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this figure was 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all known as asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no battle against war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum Rights in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; 2021 will not take place again at the end of summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; more stupid than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land ground combat - that is bit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you can &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : during the holidays are hel@@ pers who hang on posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and count on votes , only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign almost by the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
&quot; exciting is , how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains to be left at the end of the coalition . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , spreads ses and ch@@ aps a little with the people , as it already did his legendary word@@ kar@@ st predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and she gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for Af@@ D &apos;s blos@@ som@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place for election campaigns at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority in other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U does not wai@@ ve the usual campaigns on market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this means co@@ ca@@ ing , plays only one &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country , it bl@@ ur@@ red the ground that it must be very demanding to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is about the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any place in the sides of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the 2011 election , the SPD won at least 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and place their electoral campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green electoral campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a trace @-@ search for domestic stimul@@ ants among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ did@@ atin , kur@@ v@@ t with a hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at by the Mecklenburg Lake and still finds it beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : Gast@@ stätten suffer under block@@ age
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30@@ am and only about 8@@ pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty z@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the remun@@ eration is also v@@ owed to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting @-@ up traffic . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Of@@ ter@@ dingen , the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the transport position within the place has been laid back . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from the B 27 on both sides from Of@@ ter@@ dingen .
the ev@@ asi@@ ve traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; said the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the management of the rehabilitation management . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many ble@@ ach trails were looking for and more familiar to their navigation than the signs . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ k .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality reinforced the exhibition vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made himself able to speak on the spot . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute fl@@ ashed .
the quick@@ est was with 77 mph kilometers in the tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone on the road .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales in sales , everyone can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight drop , &quot; &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; hard hit . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be glad about every euro turnover .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the road renovation took its operation &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he has to dism@@ iss half of his collabor@@ ators .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dism@@ issed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation with the advice , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other country circles , where so much more generous is handled . &quot;
&quot; in all the suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot go down , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the renovation work , his master cli@@ de returns to the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its inn@@ s in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being bol@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; following the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a D@@ ul@@ ite status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the German Minister of Interior in the introduction of his new security package . &quot;
they claim no one .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in it . &quot;
&quot; but as Minister of Interior , he was placed on results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will have a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but this is all the more extensive .
&quot; some are already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cr@@ acking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement multiple EU guidelines on passenger information and tru@@ ce law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals not to be done with the SPD : he wants to recru@@ it sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he does not consider this to be reasonable and also does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented to de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deportation and more opportunities for det@@ ecting people before deportation .
&quot; refugees , targeted at the country , should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for security checks . &quot;
&quot; in case of cancell@@ ations for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately disc@@ ard their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are politically and legally sacred .
some also have an effect on un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated ones for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to argue that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; moreover , in view of the high refugee figures , many people were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things , which the people deeply occupied , did not suff@@ ice to cling to election campaigns . &quot;
internal security is enorm@@ ously put into focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking place in the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high rise between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ome dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the council chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also ar@@ ouses for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a return from the double @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
we have been talking about the discussion in Germany .
re@@ viewing it is not useful .
&quot; and with a ban on bur@@ ka , he has constitutional complaints . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional in all corners , and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must still be shown . &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about .
but even the SPD is trying to pro@@ actively shape itself on the topic of internal security .
&quot; Sig@@ mar Gabriel only pointed out to be cau@@ tious about willingness to talk and say , &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming through .
&quot; despite the diesel engine , the delivery figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall action there are vor@@ tices about a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half @-@ year in the shipments of deliveries .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to demonstrate a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July the core brand was weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sale , as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand in July sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
market sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann driven the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also stressed , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ aff@@ ars first escal@@ ated , a minus is also a be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales record from January to July . &quot;
&quot; in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles were delivered to Volkswagen in this time , 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million cars to convert into workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the conversion , Volkswagen reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car engineer , after the conversion , made a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason is legal refin@@ ements .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen ear@@ marked its German customers with a guarantee of equipped diesel models . &quot;
&quot; last Monday , this would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the change@@ over , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not how it was called business trips . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come into a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could be trac@@ ed back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal @-@ sc@@ andal , resulting in uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal investigations in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; chief Apostle Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks talks about an individual case and does not see a signal : normal spar@@ s would not fear , to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; when banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee does not charge Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he kept 40 million euros for some time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to another and which he could not evaluate . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros .
he now continues the cost according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; to leave the cash in the treas@@ ury of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the CFO . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry it alone , &quot; &quot; business @-@ efficient permanently is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ bank and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private customers have to pay nationwide compensation for deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a bit more lav@@ ish@@ ly equipped by the property . &quot;
this can become a problem for a small bank if they pay money for free .
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , no further banks are known to the co @-@ oper@@ atives &apos; association that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives compared to the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
&quot; before comm@@ itting to the comment section to over@@ see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ ot@@ ment of men &apos;s middle ages with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attribut@@ able to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely comb@@ ating group . &quot;
it is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and fer@@ ment wil@@ dly before I stop , keep my hands and some determin@@ ations like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly eng@@ ages at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I &apos;m by S@@ ister Ray ( numbers : two young women , three men middle @-@ aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( numbers : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these vinyl records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy and buy items that he sold when he was young and ready . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70@@ ies , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pump , people who heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sound@@ sc@@ ars , of objects that wake up happy rejo@@ icing . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee is in@@ stig@@ ating a pile of records . &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet stopped .
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I was blowing through a pile of Bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle @-@ aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone recently came here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound board so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ consuming , less music @-@ like . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly enter . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged teenagers . &quot;
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts novel synthes@@ izer and sex@@ tet pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ill@@ ers from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks particularly lonely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are difficult to find when you stand beside someone 30 seconds long . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a man@@ nequ@@ in as a big shopping mall .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of board lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the impression of pattern the jeans @-@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors in reality , record shops and online forums exist . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the st@@ rolling through plates of the Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates , while they avoid the stub@@ born view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who over@@ looks the shoulders of nothing strange men middle @-@ aged . &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses , in which individuals sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dres@@ sers , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that stores and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups cannot provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum causes for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure would be for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants held on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympia dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; it is hon@@ estly difficult for me to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he must analyse in peace , which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le . &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
&quot; looking at other people playing video games is a huge one - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit . &quot;
&quot; the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby . &quot;
&quot; as much money goes for the acquisition , Microsoft didn &apos;t share it on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch others while playing , but also intervene . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give up missions and face enemies and provide equipment . &quot;
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard is launching a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
&quot; on the way to global media event , Facebook is to help Facebook . &quot;
the advertising industry is already listening .
&quot; the employees of the start @-@ up , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft Office in the California Red@@ mond , like Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video gaming department around the Xbox console . &quot;
the market of live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .

&quot; in 2014 , T@@ witch was bought from the online retail@@ er Amazon - for almost one billion dollars . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , the tem@@ pos@@ u@@ des should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; for example , the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accidents , where the police were too dangerous for a mobile measurement . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to re@@ building bridges with temporary speed poles , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps five days at un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive from time , timet@@ able and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , it is possible to move the trailer according to the manufacturer by car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also fail @-@ safe outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 items last year . &quot;
Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets fet@@ ched
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by in the final on Thursday evening came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium .
&quot; Fi@@ ji granted a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , back@@ rest , line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad comfort of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the strong defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lose one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderfully and let the attacks boun@@ ce from fun .
&quot; it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. , as if one would run into driving coaches . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was over@@ covered in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a prepar@@ atory T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mount of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua put a touch down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the restart and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still available . &quot;
this is the way it is .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ yan gap ... for four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans whose fans sang and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame translated the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB kick@@ ed anni@@ hil@@ ated in the grass . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a short semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bu@@ cks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no emot@@ ive gold than with these games and that wants what will mean .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which enter the history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when she rac@@ ed for the second Olympic old in two @-@ wheel@@ er without tax , the first women in the history of British sport that put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ ter un@@ covered use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more respon@@ sive than the coach who would survive 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right term at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts came to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ moving morning with a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something rab@@ bit .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small Francon@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was written in an article by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
&quot; a little later , the Wasser@@ forum of the Government of Lower Francon@@ ia paid tribute to the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the forced association of employees , including 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes around 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller set out as a water @-@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they stretched from water @-@ line construction and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies in weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the inaugur@@ ation and initi@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the restructuring of the high container ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial regeneration of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always taken up new changes because water is drinking and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose band@@ age , and he has lived up to the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller on his side praised Aqu@@ arian Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a faithful fl@@ ap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he called the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ation of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the quar@@ ry at the high container in Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn , too , can only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it .
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the sickness was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot;
&quot; but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead , and is now privately held in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

type of Rel@@ ation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man sho@@ ots on life @-@ partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the flight , according to him I will publicly ins@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man carries a bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lübeck sought to make no information on the Ta@@ ther@@ pass or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not say more , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operation kom@@ mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - light view for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ controlled and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from green circulation are from the table .
&quot; in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Restru@@ c@@ turing Unit in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Finance signed Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission initially planned to use steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission on talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , all an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent will be replaced . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ creation .
&quot; in doing so , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts by Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
&quot; last year , the situation escal@@ ated further , when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw massive steel on the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies pricing dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties of import duties indicate the import steel effect ; secondly , economic prospects have risen in China . &quot;
un@@ clear is how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to exclude closed lock@@ ings of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes of crude steel , they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Industry Association announced on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the produced quantity went back for the second month in a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp to her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the Deutsche Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , senior citizens can make and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast in everyday life as quickly as possible .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs awak@@ ens many memories with older people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia patients are sin@@ king for long past events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people , who live alone , do not only focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I do something for a long time , I will be better and a@@ wo@@ ke beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby shouldn &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks , have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear there when a sound is next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , it is easy to join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the Church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ ver to scre@@ am of young animals
&quot; bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect has the effect of catching k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to their surprise the male also didn &apos;t leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ ch@@ ment of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by 10 percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; although k@@ itt@@ ens also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ ment of less and strongly arous@@ ed fry for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous examination , the research team already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cry with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female females of the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry were observed .
they were performed for a herd of babies who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens which were additionally raised . &quot;
the researchers consider their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ am , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls for the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off . &quot;
this ability may be presum@@ ed or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women responded more sensi@@ tively to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ sky attacks Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is again taking place an important football match . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the Arch@@ du@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even during the suspension of the emergency state after the crash test in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len which is responsible for the coup attempt .
&quot; in doing so , football does not stop before football . &quot;
&quot; against the former st@@ ark@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the South @-@ West living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kü@@ r is to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; it is true that for 90 days , the state of exception is still valid until October , in fact , it has as good as no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places throughout the country have declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; in the event of &quot; &quot; podium &quot; &quot; gala , it will be especially arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; his sporting value was shown by the Cologne in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory button .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team to the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also play an early stage in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the south of Li@@ g , it reached only sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who played the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ pf@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , only borrow@@ ed from the AC in Florence , had only been announced after the coup attempt to return because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; club chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the Stür@@ mer would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of its worth of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; his salary in Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted ath@@ lete sinners can laugh about it - they fight in Rio to Med@@ als .
the topic dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had su@@ ed her start right after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly p@@ itted and rested on her start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scenery : with a super@@ imposed smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed that they were not going to get gold , the audience broke out into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; however , there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here &apos;s an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champions was even faster than before , he is the number one in the world for more than 100 metres and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had severe tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championship was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant remedy meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic lod@@ ged the know@@ ingly taking and was closed six months .
the four most extensive lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ as .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Peking Olympic Champion and two World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positively in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement have been responsible for eu@@ than@@ ized mer@@ cen@@ sion .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete was able to detect so many medals afterwards . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after testosterone dop@@ ing was observed .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized , was given back to CAS due to a judgment of the International Sports Court . &quot;
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ as were first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old world champion , references have been found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA dropped mil@@ de and went off on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Multiple T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; they suffered chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the other explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he are also affected by Austrian citizens , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , two explo@@ sions went up , and another person was killed , according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police data . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal government . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the territorial police . &quot;
&quot; finally , there were more det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bombing ra@@ ids carry the same signature , &quot; said Ar@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express himself to potential motives - however , it is probably the case of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern which is typical of the bom@@ b@@ ins of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks did not stand in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one assumes that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still be un@@ clear what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police demonstrated its officials throughout the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the well @-@ gro@@ unded bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian State Department recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security agencies . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) paid for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after conflicts between the security forces and the Muslim population , it is not necessary to get into these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this also gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ cha @-@ cha said that bombs were an attempt to stal@@ k chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ tains itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting the grip of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok they were killed in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is into the visor of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several federal offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identi@@ fiable movement &apos; indications for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said Mr Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ essen of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic belief or the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional Gu@@ ards in nine provinces - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; &quot; identified &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ arten said , his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Head . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; identical &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ arten said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the clear increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ine said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but we have seen in recent years that there can be law @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other legally @-@ terrorism group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee protests or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ arten expressed that many gri@@ ps went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers have not been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or have chosen CD@@ U , SPD or left who , however , have radic@@ alised the right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympics or World records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Centre , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am that it was no longer visible in the TV images . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his run with a rec@@ ess of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is still participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ represented countries known .
&quot; because in eth@@ op@@ ies most sport@@ s@@ men run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media marked it as &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot;
&quot; referring to a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; made it funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he stroke only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so close
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks about an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video . &quot;
he then dri@@ fted into the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump is losing the U.S. presidential elections in November , it would be relatively no matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of political correctness , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he thus called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;

&quot; in view of the last bad fi@@ ber@@ ty business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if this was the case with BMW , that would also make the quests so , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; based on the first half @-@ year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros decreased by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was largely due to its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; in the Consumer Experience business unit , the company &apos;s value sales of 139 million euros were awarded to the Group under the line , a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros . &quot;

accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to his information , had to ev@@ ade an opposite truck which partly rode on the road . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person by the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; because of the location of the bus , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency vehicles came to the accident site at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the lor@@ ries and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; from October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of waste water will amount to 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 26 euros ( until now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased again at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a r@@ ack@@ et calculation , the wast@@ ewater fee in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the permission of the househ@@ older was established by the Council of Agriculture in Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ewater treatment plants . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ covering . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
fee increases lie between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative leader Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , a new calculation of fees for wast@@ ewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period may also be compens@@ ated . &quot;
Schmidt founded Schmidt in order to provide relatively small facilities with a very low waste @-@ waste inc@@ iner@@ ator between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age of renovation and repair expenses , all three facilities were not least pleasing due to their age of renovation and repair expenses . &quot;
&quot; the Az@@ endorf plant is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ewater facility had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es of and an additional ventilation system to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs came into account , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made clear that in the case of low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were completely sm@@ ashed .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt supplemented the market community of large entertainment costs in the wast@@ ewater facilities over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the view of stone houses , especially since the supply area of the waste @-@ purpose association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal cannot be expanded in order to be able to extend these facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % were booked .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared with June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it &apos;s in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already bor@@ dered to absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ clear , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ car@@ riages are sent to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past when they were accused of suggest@@ ing that the App Black@@ face promoted or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week suggested some users a filter which gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and enlighten@@ ed che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es showed a greater problem that the company has a diversity .
&quot; the news and the indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat that it turned out the feature down@@ lighted . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced r@@ attle dis@@ m , rec@@ alled the filter to vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others opted for the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely distributed across the photographs , that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and the least unpleasant . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contra@@ sting of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not loos@@ ely secured , but that the yellow @-@ face was drag@@ ged into the disc@@ ar@@ ded extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling wire .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are different in the breed than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that rac@@ ed controversi@@ es reflect lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently set up a staff responsible for sub@@ stit@@ uting population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will make her Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership dist@@ orted IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw up an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual states of Congress had allowed the Congress to report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican Members of the Army Committee , Intelligence Committee and the Defence Force , reports on great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command &apos;s intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , typically kick@@ ed off by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states could have allowed and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analysts face pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Congress of Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely restricted process for the creation of intelligence services to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ ranking Democrats in the committee , Adam B. Schiff , announced in a position . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; har@@ med mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave excessive room for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House &apos;s intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who was accepted after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the General In@@ spec@@ tor &apos;s investigations were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also assumed that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have revers@@ ed the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , as the former government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to make himself aware of the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker speci@@ fies that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there were no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger instruction , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his exc@@ essi@@ vely positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is at hand &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a worthy performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead to .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have spark@@ ed a surprising whir@@ ling through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places during the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team , began to turn things to a better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we have now .
we have been able to ro@@ b the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and pl@@ ung@@ ed the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US door@@ ke@@ epers , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable , a rapid relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning stick , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ guards to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn the TV , read a newspaper or listen when talking to your neighbors in the coffee shop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ decker , or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a woman &apos;s warm with dimples , could certainly have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ being TV ads when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ ast , or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ols , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ ms of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so sc@@ ary perceived that many that I had asked , did not know that it is at all an olymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the United States sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider &apos;s char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has a hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ist tre@@ mor of its never @-@ ending impact , but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline which means so much means &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ eck and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , you will be judged according to the performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the bas@@ eline , but also another height goal in the TV transmission : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I think about watching these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ acker and the obj@@ ec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot;
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police were killed during sho@@ ot@@ ings .
is Ethiopia just to collapse ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread in more and more areas .
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the response of the government has been rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses reported that polic@@ emen fired and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security professionals hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Committee is now calling for a further investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , while dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ asting in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after an extensive election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this un@@ disputed , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been defeated more or less in recent years , protect the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess are now explo@@ ding under the surface after years of bit@@ ing .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media , because cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government ob@@ tains access to Facebook and Twitter what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they were so close to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from eth@@ th@@ op@@ ia predominantly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are in co @-@ ordin@@ ating under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ mo@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and domin@@ ates the military , the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , has been an Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was considered tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in taking early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime lacks this basic fate , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to the statistics of analysts apparently ple@@ aded by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and that time of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , and for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ gi@@ vings of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters took place in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ bush town , by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for stron@@ gh@@ olds on the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently concluded that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le territory . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ gh@@ tro@@ pe walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication gave new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of it during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump retired regarding the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help we@@ aken the statement , remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would suggest proposals to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism , when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction happens . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received an even et@@ ching note since his survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a great lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump has generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ators , gave himself great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ b@@ anded , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being ro@@ uted on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , twi@@ sted &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps excuse than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a pe@@ arly coffee shop in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that has no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue front line were displaced . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which was set up in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
native people smoked it as the last loss in a city of gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is a change , it is also a new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new out@@ lay , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
verb uses the same Distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ted onions .
there are natural tear dishes .
&quot; the café does not serve beer any more , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also driven by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived previously in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the club closed , she gave a while coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably always stood the same .
&quot; I came quarter to seven , every day like a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with Butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing b@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he didn &apos;t make a gru@@ dge about it , that the soap shop took the old business room . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to produce a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to issue them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the coffee @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the locom@@ otive and the order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen from Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , schn@@ au@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em i@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh salad with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter asked h@@ ackers , this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little che@@ ap@@ ly that stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the ways with which the country changed to be no longer the land of Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as excited was the new budget : mysterious foods such as bread and water @-@ no@@ d@@ ules became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rarely ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
strange mix@@ tures have been tested because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfying appe@@ aled to taste or even healthy common sense .
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , budget econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - ab@@ rup@@ tly the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke like the milli@@ on@@ ful man of the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was glori@@ fied in reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute an ex@@ mark with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ cris@@ y of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt said that the White House created the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was disc@@ ar@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our ongoing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of w@@ asting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the storm of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the offspring dessert , which President Roosev@@ elt did eat lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , adding that it was a normal trick to give a modest name to the recipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly , a spo@@ on@@ ful in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ter , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed by bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a bombing of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war area first aid .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian guards , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; he never saw himself as a hero , said the picture : &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think God is seeing a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters had dropped four bomb bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we are now removing the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland hai : the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ ie comes up with up to 150 years of age .
&quot; the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats up at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal speeds up 2.@@ 6@@ km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
this slow@@ ed lifestyle seems to be a treat for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed long ago , that Greenland ha@@ ie will become stone age . &quot;
only l@@ acked the evidence .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie is hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ ie .
their time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ rus measures them when they equi@@ p six animals with a transmitter ahead of S@@ val@@ bard .
&quot; nevertheless , the loo@@ t do this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and are looking for cad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 502 centimet@@ res measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the len@@ tic@@ ular core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably lots of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
&quot; their birth , therefore , should lie in the early 1960s , when atomic weapons search for greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the len@@ tic@@ ular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , which is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland ha@@ irs , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their len@@ tic@@ ular core , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length were able to assign an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this may also be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ ages live above all in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; also the previous record holder , an 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , where bac@@ on on the neck had a 120 year old har@@ poon lace , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ parag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very big . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal stands at heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
a very large animal should be investing more in a long life on the other hand .
building plot in a double pack
&quot; with topics relating to construction , the municipal council has focused on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the real estate , plot and closure issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on survey@@ ing , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction section 1 ) is no longer in the way to interested parties . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and ru@@ sty senior citizens alike .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ lige can immediately report to the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to make inquiries concerning the settlement of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created surface protection plan in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city of the Main has the best chance to recru@@ it jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt benefits most of the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Centre Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK has so far been sufficient to them . &quot;
this is using just great US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , and other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority , E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , though , is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg has a large fund sector , but also cuts down in terms of Dublin in terms of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is significantly easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the town with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not as easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Frankfurt offers higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the business consultancy Merc@@ er , the city ranks seventh , Luxemburg on No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the forces of forces also speak : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal charges from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a U.S. in@@ verter decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. claims the reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs , which you have created from the hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated by a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ cks , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead claims to reimbur@@ se the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck lam@@ ented each other and took ownership of laboratory work to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir landed , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the US supported troops have reg@@ ained full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city abandoned them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , according to the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liber@@ ated more than 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Reuters military council together with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are running Au@@ dre@@ aming , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published her tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , this resulted in the presidential candidate of Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declaration of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind wrong exc@@ uses and res@@ ellers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements even though they are not oblig@@ ated by law to do so .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election hero Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s special advis@@ ors , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal raises questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business pairs and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already thrown himself on the issue and published a video on the internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump to publish his tax declaration .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke to the topic also during a speech to the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done during the last decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a scheme that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an IR@@ S tax examination and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not against tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax declaration back until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that they were only USD 100 of their income as a wage , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment situation was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea many years ago , has intensi@@ fied its support along with the US nature protection by using volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Health Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant in doing so , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ating of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works body in a con@@ dom , whose end is shot to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts up with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a ver@@ fer who sho@@ ots a gold @-@ fired fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director breaks Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock , after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not find Israeli pre @-@ election as it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision on the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more angry in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has been applied in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the Internet where people knew the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; some under@@ went the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged &quot; &quot; promp@@ ts of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly referred to all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; to not take Israel into the fast @-@ dial list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police places Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ rat@@ osse against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se students , which led to the police of Gum@@ mig@@ u@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ors saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts spr@@ inging up against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators of the masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been dism@@ issed by a vote of the Senate on their dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in the Russian companies was growing strongly in the country , the ambassador said . &quot;
Russian companies take up existing links with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , another commercial extension is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial recovery was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representative issued around 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses wanted : beverage market falling into Wald@@ br@@ öl
&quot; on Thursday evening , a rob@@ ber@@ y fall has been put on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße . &quot;
&quot; under the maintenance of a gun , three dark cloth@@ ed persons , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , had the release of cash and then escaped first on foot and then probably with a silver coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was exploited , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been large between 1,60 and 1.70 m , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators must be scann@@ ed after the attack in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have made observations on the crime time ( against 19.@@ 45 ) are urgently reported to the police in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y .
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the socio @-@ educational daily group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection association Nag@@ old , with their assistants on their summer vac@@ ancy in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
in the quietly located Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was accommod@@ ated during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
for one thing we went to board with the visit of the string z@@ oos .
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide at the world @-@ famous clo@@ ister . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; during the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invites to jump , swimming and splash . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers with their homemade past@@ ries , like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops have been made to create beautiful gem@@ s made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people laugh@@ ed happily . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ stries from the pastoral unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ Wall trip of all the Ministers in the next two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ ten@@ Round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and you finally decided to visit the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where this year &apos;s mercy was given to the mercy of the mercy on Fri@@ bourg &apos;s Münster cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the pastor sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m@@ ages and told the pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , he was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster &apos;s beloved wife stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was taken away from the Münster . &quot;
&quot; each day tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and in the evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is , chap@@ els or churches always made rest to sing together a song from specially organized pilgri@@ m lyrics . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and vigor@@ ous dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the day after the day , the stage went to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , but first of all , some 500 meters of altitude had to be desc@@ ended and then recovered . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the lake in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse at the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and went through the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was given thanks . &quot;
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to see the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day there was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner sha@@ ved last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , which his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took sixth place in March at the World Championships in London despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ der appeared .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement testi@@ fied a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the gravel that has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he was barely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and sk@@ inn@@ ed . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation to slow down in a higher gear to slow it down and to enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they stepped on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there were indications that after a weak start he inten@@ tionally dropped onto the track . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
we have so badly lost with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle of Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal race of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race . &quot;
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; he had fought with officers before the qualification yesterday , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women competition tomorrow continued and finished , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on its strong web wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a flock of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background , such as the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mop@@ ed pen@@ alties as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
the future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land is question@@ able due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy order
&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supplier agreement and thereby elev@@ ates all delivery contracts , as the supplying energy company hur@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy imposed for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk at a shut@@ down .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ down with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L still said that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging business &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of termination so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L recei@@ pts from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong retail prices for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L stated that the value of the contracts has already been written down in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; &quot; expectation of termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure power supply to the melting &quot; &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it signed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it has with@@ drawn from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the analy@@ st &apos;s statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as an electricity producer this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the trademark ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ ver brought me cry , &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , scann@@ ed reality video , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of her sister and that ends with a classical twist : they all have a surprise party planned . &quot;
&quot; this depic@@ ts the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ ha@@ iry plot of almost every birthday episode of a child &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we forgot you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a channel at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista was from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zers 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still le@@ ak@@ ing before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ert &apos;s success does not like any success . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ inger &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ carriage , it seems to pass the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes public@@ ity for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal law centers exhibit 16@@ 0,000 people annually &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary services are accoun@@ ted annually by the municipal administration centres , while the sector is preparing for the impact of further mi@@ tigation on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and the like - in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ law@@ fully exploited , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , further 30 per cent of its federal funds will be lost . &quot;
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell community centers said that the last survey of the National Association of Municip@@ alities revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without abol@@ ishing the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal law centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ able and oppres@@ sive debt , families that have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dism@@ issed wrong@@ ly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of more vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these aver@@ ages , so that people can get the assistance they need for legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for judicial assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their clients , as well as that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign indic@@ ted after employees allegedly pulled weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was a fire@@ arm on one employee while in February they were in a je@@ ep .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed by Vincent Bord@@ ini on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
Bord@@ ini gave up for months that the matter would be internally regulated before he realized that &quot; that would not happen .
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand @-@ finger on the trigger , and ran the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave up in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to raise damage , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave . &quot;
&quot; the indictment appears only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate had triggered a rebellion when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his ri@@ val should be elected Clinton and appoint judge . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not cont@@ end violence .
B@@ anks &apos;s complaint requests damages from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Press Brief@@ ing Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip likewise failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; calls at his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of Countries Elec@@ tions : losing the SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are significant losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have good chances to keep the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD dropped from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are returning to Schwer@@ iner &apos;s Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Parliament with 3 percent each .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors now dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not well in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite a t@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it Computer Fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west @-@ pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive SMS and e @-@ mails for that time , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , although very slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price is quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
the market today go@@ vern vendors who were all much later than Nokia .
&quot; being online anytime and anywhere , it &apos;s everyday for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices sold , on Samsung and Apple sold alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running shops of the pay@@ less app providers and telecommunications companies are coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone has become a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything with touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple began its triumph@@ al march , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had the night vision . &quot;
&quot; they van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the legends now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , each German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for the Siemens Management Board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will have 10,000 new appren@@ tices alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be playing on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they are also wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked to him . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have chosen a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion invested infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software vendors try to b@@ ypass an ad block , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ eboard on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the coding on his ad advertisements , to make it difficult to identify which part of the page advertising is to complain . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man from Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o battle is underway between the anti @-@ clock@@ wise open source community and the res@@ cu@@ ers since the invention of scor@@ cer@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator block@@ ers have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study of last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , use some 200 million people display lock@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company apart from ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues , so Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preference tool &quot; &quot; to get people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would cause new filters to be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , so instead we focus on developers tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
woman at suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , who was over@@ hau@@ led by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died still on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , told us to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases where one person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers must not assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the casual kill@@ ings after passing a man and killed a man in August 2014 at the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- was in a justi@@ fiable way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus probably was once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have once referred to similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously suggest@@ ing that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still revol@@ ved slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host lives and protected it from faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than Earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously suspected by planets research . &quot;
&quot; although it was once believed to be hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gene , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , the way we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy returned to Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give him greater depth , and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right to take decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today , Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot;
&quot; he took the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the night season in each of the two last years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference for five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;

&quot; labour struggles with regard to remun@@ eration for North @-@ Sea oil workers are exposed , while all the dispute parties sit at the table for a new round of discussion , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the Wood field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the un@@ winding process of the current strike , &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot;
we will stop some full day sessions over the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice is followed by a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has been released for thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alis@@ es its business activities as a result of its meg@@ a union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was strengthened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of star , age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now fastest .
&quot; at peak rates , these three stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars revol@@ ve slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the press rates of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial b@@ az@@ aar star emerges
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return release , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees on 12 August against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to both , &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 , he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has awarded him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back with performance for a long time . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 , he managed to create some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the hall of glory . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; announced that ster@@ oids banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to its involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as the main suspect , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida . &quot;
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back to the south . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days do not run nois@@ el@@ essly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Y@@ ank@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ du@@ als Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
an ear@@ thy ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically observed athle@@ tics competition these news are coming to the un@@ season . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ ating agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the screening of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B trial and a hearing requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association &quot; &quot; takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and calls for Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the san@@ ction of the ath@@ lete with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it was innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; declared the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ trial should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly filed with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not have the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dou@@ bling @-@ laden nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both may dispute the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation of IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team until one exception due to systematic d@@ op@@ ings , also the runner @-@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the previous transgres@@ sions in China had also taken care of fierce battles between the athletes . &quot;
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun stood at the centre of an examination with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese champ@@ ionships in 2014 for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ ac@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
dat@@ ag@@ lob@@ al : fi@@ fi@@ de presses H@@ acker their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware currently attack companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes toward attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially too high @-@ pressure ran@@ som can be significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we currently monitor a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most painting programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ altered files such as Word@@ - , Excel , or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the final turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : does not pay , it only promotes the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in the light of down@@ time in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure insp@@ ected the user forces and contact with the users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private people rede@@ em payments of only a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate some hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software building kit to the actual Er@@ pres@@ ser .
&quot; the previous malware kits were created by the malware , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the pres@@ ser then searches for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set of a criminal and arran@@ ges another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually criminals then commission sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies @-@ IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not an adequate threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the potential for damages depends on the type of data still a much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also completely take up new targets on the internet of things in the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat integrated with the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in the future instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the little HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any position . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit top is something that falls off . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l in the back@@ rests of up to 10@@ 26 l , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a child seat , thus providing storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m from the ground up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should do his job somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
&quot; the security systems belong to the City @-@ emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assistance wiz@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because he ranks many obstacles in the ranking as &quot; &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the smart temp@@ or@@ eg@@ ler respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t the speed if necessary .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation , navigation and more . &quot;
two USB and an HDMI socket are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the approx . 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ dies@@ els are fine .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will receive from 200@@ 00 euros , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car with the HR @-@ V .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is conceivable only for dangers , which are typical of aviation . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee pit after the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
disease : when pays the organizer
&quot; after their journey , sick leave will only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without doubt . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a hearing , a family was suffering from diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faul@@ ty wast@@ ewater treatment that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family had the view that the trip was so flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
&quot; in fact , the wast@@ ewater treatment was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er learned only shortly before the plain@@ ti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus the judgment . &quot;
no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ r@@ ked .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have taken care of further attacks . &quot;
the state must be inspired and determined at the same time to react to terrorism .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not treat this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; if perpetr@@ ators had to leave the country faster , it increased security and also the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ scale order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ ce is so novel@@ ty that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more complicated . &quot;
the last much discussed Schwei@@ gh@@ tist for physicians should remain maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères terms .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to seek solutions such as the endanger@@ ing of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psych@@ ical ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister is keeping a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against action .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère rejected calls from the Union after a ban on bur@@ ka and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality .
a general ban on full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional law .
&quot; it is not possible to for@@ bid everything that one re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses against court .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter rejected the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act power and ability to act . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verbs and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the common law do not bring the people in this land more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right @-@ wing ratio is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers , who stand in traffic at the ambient street every night in traffic when they drive over the highway , Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
road construction extends over the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure of Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ off track by 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then drive directly from the Hammer Street to the right .
&quot; the major advantage : the traffic is split early , whereby the overall procedure is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District , represented in Münster @-@ West . &quot;
&quot; the train lane on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot;
week@@ days go back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ g path and sometimes also beyond .
&quot; for this reason , the eye tube is on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic is guided only on track via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rebuilt a well @-@ three @-@ quarters years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to absorb heavy @-@ duty traffic in particular . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work@@ day traffic jam will continue , the competent state operation cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to be reck@@ oned : because the bridge has an official remaining period of time up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal regulation , the state operation deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project now .
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; organized by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students visited the small house between eleven and fifteen years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , who has set up the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background have been given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language education are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee figures , the association anticip@@ ates many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of stars : hope for better weather
the weather has made the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain , watching the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see a lot of stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ shed is per@@ sei@@ des , which with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest star @-@ sho@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come out of the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep in the morning . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent sense their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ep , member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ gery and sleep medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands land@@ ring , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , one in and through sleep disturb@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; just asleep , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleeping disorder is an expression of another condition .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is often frequent in depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ del . &quot;
and it can be that different factors would like to thank each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a disk failure , can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I become a doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; whoever does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised in the day should go to the doctor , betra@@ y wo@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : you are sm@@ itten , tired , uncomfortable , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve sleep disturb@@ ance , it is important to find out whose causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any sleep medicine in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first contact the specialist doctor , advis@@ es wo@@ es . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with research whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab and what happens ?
&quot; for the examination in the sleep laboratory physician , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing replac@@ ements , in case of sickness , in@@ som@@ nia or if one does not find the cause of sleep disturb@@ ance , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the em@@ placement one goes to bed at its normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eder at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can I get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite many screws where you can sit for a better sleep .
&quot; at night , you don &apos;t have to sleep in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , not watch TV for sleeping , stop drinking alcohol and not at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve at all . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time and at the same time exhibited his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his critics . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € and a j@@ unk of 150,000 € shouldn &apos;t be surprised by missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look exactly at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , he would have to be announced nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A should not take part , &quot; says the election @-@ Hamburg , who has meanwhile run an ice @-@ di@@ ele . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Lu@@ gg@@ age Gu@@ ards arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage theft as a ban@@ de .
&quot; at 9 : 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy since the middle of July and were collec@@ tively , both professionally and professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime committee 34 can demonstrate four acts , especially for prosec@@ uting crimes committed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the process , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between , still a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not affect the first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from east to west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
someone spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house !
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; article on this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is called , will however be adverti@@ sed with burning cars over the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared by 300 police officers , the police pat@@ ro@@ bed official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visiting the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the house . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ee of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main source of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs three children here , are mainly gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to bring about a majority of police protection from the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police make up between home occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which also today has a lower average income and high poverty rate compared to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the R@@ ī@@ ga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and bal@@ ers from all over the world over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at drawn s@@ lic@@ ed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown into the bag .
no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours watch this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against police officers . &quot;
most of the crimes make property damage that tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant house for 17 years alongside the con@@ ten@@ tious 94 , cannot be a question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be . &quot;
also the famous burning cars will no longer give it any longer in the R@@ ī@@ ga .
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately with@@ drawn into the R@@ ī@@ ga Street - and stayed .
&quot; for that reason , it was also so important that the natives get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the clear@@ ness over the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through historical buildings in former buildings that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are , ultimately , con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well bet@@ tered , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone has never listened to ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of color bombs , the skin project and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who pul@@ ls , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area that can complain about noise there . &quot;
all persons presented only with first names have asked to not be called with their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the experience of wool which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less spot@@ less than rather on the variety of requ@@ is@@ ite tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write down the place . &quot;
&quot; an administrative assistant was chosen with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an egg @-@ cutting wo@@ olen l@@ chs@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; most of all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities . &quot;
the 31 year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers are standing in the W@@ as@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find flats for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented flats .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Council &apos;s Office to Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search is very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; until now , it does not work until you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be replaced as it is so beautiful . &quot;
new containers will soon be set up in the W@@ as@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , school places , one @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean job .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people need to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it is just and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems , too , says the customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do they have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would bring them completely into call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region . &quot;
they always in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy to integrate the existing human beings wis@@ ely .
&quot; these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : un@@ break@@ er wanted with helicop@@ ters
the police helicop@@ ters flew different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forced on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 clock for@@ ci@@ bly into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and beat the cl@@ ums@@ y in the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.70 meters large , probably m@@ asked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded swe@@ ats . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
&quot; to commemor@@ ate the police , police put several squ@@ ad@@ rons and a helicopter . &quot;
the flag ran without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , indeed , fell near the apartment or when they were fle@@ eing . &quot;
