<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, looked for a little diversion with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">"CHIO:" "golden Sports Pyramid" "for Bernhard Langer"</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebration, they hunted in the fast gallop home to the feeding troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this speed, I am afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the equestrian career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever was - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let his family run over the annex of the ALRV, on a horse, he did not even catch himself for photography."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbertal Laurel leaf, champion-tour player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen swelled him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prizewinner of the Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, on Saturday, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting young talent."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the double award winner was added to the" Hall of Fame des deutschen SPORTS "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the founder Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sporting legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company emigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza prize went."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal - that is what Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two US presidential candidates, however, are undivided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in case of doubt, Trump wants to keep in doubt small and warns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wanted taxing the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, it would be quite different, claimed Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will make a massive return to regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open the disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in which to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like."</seg>
<seg id="14">S & D Group's news on the European Parliament's Plenary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-critical teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could still be partial-party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Trump wants to build coal power plants, and re-establish coal mining in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement aims to terminate it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand renewable energies with their investment programme:" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both don't want to isolate the US from international trade - but just protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, ask Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of US $7.25 is a wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rink, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics beware that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least demand from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of women who are fleeing themselves almost everyday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are favilions.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs has opened up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the flight outweigh:" many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tug for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany, Irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that approximately 90 per cent of women living in the housing in the North of Munich are traumatised, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often don't help themselves, I need more accommodations just for them, urges Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some say no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in housing of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together, it may become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as much as the women feel this need of protection, one can read the urge to give it to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since he has been saying that there are us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily get a second house.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant Dentists: demands for new employment campaigns</seg>
<seg id="2">Representatives of the Assistance Physicians have called upon their union to approve new employment campaigns against their disputes regarding a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC insisted that ministers had failed to respond to concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" "persistently calmly" "had problems, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "considering this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requested official renegotiations to all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour campaigns that begin at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance specialists in this year were fighting six times, the first total failure in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The Head of the BMA Assistance Physicians Dr. Johann Malawana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the sessions, which still took place before the vote by 54,000 assistance physicians and medical students, with that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands, and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated ballroom of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile had a dirty effect, and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly by his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even further improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there was never something bad."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accusing Ankara to fall back to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the vintment becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he has been enthroned almost his office last month with a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late imperial rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West since its reaction to the attempted takeover of power was considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent anger about the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pious to draw advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regimes."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this brilliant palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as an analyst once described me," "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that violate the West and feel poorly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents on the press conference said they would not even have striped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey denounced it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State would at least speak with one another."</seg>

<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">"he shared the BBC Scotland with" "the RSB brand becomes our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now more to a bank of brands."</seg>

<seg id="16">"I say now that we do not pursue any global goals, but also local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the board of directors. "</seg>

<seg id="5">"in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that without stating reasons" the dismissal Ivanovs ordered from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential office. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who was a deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born 1972 in Tallinn's Estonian capital, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is (in Russian) that he later became the Chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state in terms of bills of law and controls, to implement your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step made Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the narrowest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff would come back on their own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">That doesn't know anyone at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once promoted as a potential president once upon a time to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - complaining about four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister."</seg>
<seg id="26">"he is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as former member of the State Security Service, KGB."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin reached power he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would violate the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he was re-elected three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossings with Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" ceiling fans, "which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slashes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of all the bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck get a concrete for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first shutter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure is trendsetting high-end construction and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the north tower on the north side, we had to close the existing gap on the north or south side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances on which the team worked, tiny - on each side they only ruined a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors should be put into duty in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 low-priced apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "Housing Concept" "for the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the favorable apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing until now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be considered social housing in future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the low-priced apartments can also be built in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is, however, Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the housing as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions of costs and is still to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, thus Bratmann writes:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, as Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program is not yet complete, because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how is the loss of more than 1300 favorable apartments, whose funding will run out over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planning olitical spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought out of the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of getting the apartments back to the price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the west city, the year-end dates back to the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be accommodated there in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city increases dramatically, one removes itself from the goal of so-called interference."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be a movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and finally on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena in pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder, and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players with their smartphones are going outside and looking for Pokémons that can be followed by a GPS, and once they have been found," "photographed" "or" "captured" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped by 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take 30 minutes to get" "coming from the sofa" "and" "being active each day" "blew on deaf ears, because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look elusive."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"whoever drives sports regularly, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also mystic game-spoilers, which must always complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has proved to be a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, gritter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="17">"it expected them to be a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much going between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="30">"Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team captain, who is called" "Oma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Kocian, who is Katholikin, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one under the female gymnast was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas has celebrated a surprising Olympic winner and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they did unexpected but masterful gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold in an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but it does not look like gymnastics across the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but reality looks like Turning is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the churches aun myriad, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more accessible and easy-to-reach gym."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"during my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urbane adolescents (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correcness blossoms in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correcness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud is knowingly ignored in Muslim communities like a crushing government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an Antarctic King, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabines to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should be able to prove their identity, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter only needs to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes not to apply removable ink on the finger of a person if they release their vote, in order to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is aimed not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial investments that are accompanied by this," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral court ruled that the reigning Mayor Luton should be relieved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry after a litany."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical manner "and that he had silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarming to the fraudulent correspondence - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding views to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it is said:" as proof, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or mundane background. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists deal with letterdial documents to stop" "election harvests." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral campaign being used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">"systematic review of the nationality of a person, in order to ensure that they are eligible."</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on applications to an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists deal with full postal stats and envelopes of letter selections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set off barriers to voting stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law that made an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Economics Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographer prohibition in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (except for Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters go to the cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after Tower Hamlet's case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unfit," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, it was pleaded guilty to the stringent requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "check-out checks" "of the election registration departments of the Town Hall."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the judgment board in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country as the Mother of Parliaments bears a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at near distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to flip the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you get closer to you from the back then you should turn first, so you can see your attacker and go out of the shot line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker squeezes before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run to the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist them, so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a guide his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and throws a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abstained his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinse knob of a towed toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing any object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going on."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to leak the rinsing knob of a towing toilet, which has been used by thousands of others may be totally repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as their own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his bowel by travelling through the world, and ate strange things as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely among a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he got up to his reputation in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample strokes showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometer number is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"he says in the film:" "that comes close to the worst, which I smoked in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm not going to lick anything here, because it is disgusting here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">Firm of the Year for Compliance Audits and Investigations Gibson Dunn & Crutcher Firm of the Year for Corporate</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstormings that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the directing of the film, added:" let me say this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had read some of the things I ordered him to lick, just like the ecelusive Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to teach Ian to lick her and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by valio in 2015 84 percent of respondents of lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of gastrointestinal and intestines and 58 per cent said they have at least occasionally use products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, the property's employees shocked the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"walls showed clinging holes, wooden boards were torn down, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for housekeeping at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strife and escape."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, was an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under circumstances, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be invoked the police regularly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing Delogated her and her partner forcibly by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They sat down for no one." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have failed to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was called in regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the church building, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and her family, as a delogation is always the last step to consider Cornwall housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be awful for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously responded to us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">"I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours, and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delocation on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of house management will now have to fob garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70g of cannabis as well as scales, parapheralia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine of money after having found guilty of the possession of a class B drug.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a grave of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 during a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"having been without a shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were coated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they are delogging renters who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police reported that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach as well as those who have been harmed by such a behaviour," "she said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court."</seg>

<seg id="4">The majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge on the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"on Thursday, Reid said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select" "Garland" "with a certain degree of certainty."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman of Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculated.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even be" "a few hundred thousand", "the President Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because of the hard drive of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, medium-term with some hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the President Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already drafted Kurdish strongholds before months, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the putsch, even secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that absorbs refugees in its own country has produced refugees," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Verbandschef accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan wants to increase the reissue to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years," Toprak, who is also CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"he said that the German government was" "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, a" witch hunt "is taking place against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">For the first time I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany, above all Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as Gülen followers destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and Säkulele," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-immediate Stiftung Dialog and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum beneficiaries in Germany because of political persecution."</seg>
<seg id="22">"on June 30, this figure was 11.386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all known as asylum seekers (39.625)."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"2021 will not take place again at the end of summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"more stupid than so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land ground combat - that is biting."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so you can't choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems: during the holidays are helpers who hang on posters, inflate balloons, spread flyers and count on votes, only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign almost by the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting is, how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains to be left at the end of the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, spreads ses and chaps a little with the people, as it already did his legendary wordkarst predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and she gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for AfD's blossoming."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy," "We create this" "has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place for election campaigns at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's parliamentary group is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority in other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU does not waive the usual campaigns on market places and before shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this means cocaing, plays only one" minor role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country, it blurred the ground that it must be very demanding to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is about the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any place in the sides of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert is also self-exposing:" you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has now called for a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the 2011 election, the SPD won at least 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the land day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and place their electoral campaign largely on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"apart from that, green electoral campaigners embark on a trace-search for domestic stimulants among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the Spitzenkandidatin, kurvt with a houseboat by the Mecklenburg Lake and still finds it beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30am and only about 8pm, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty zackly," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the remuneration is also vowed to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting-up traffic."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen, the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the transport position within the place has been laid back."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from the B 27 on both sides from Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," "said the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the management of the rehabilitation management."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many bleach trails were looking for and more familiar to their navigation than the signs."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were frank.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality reinforced the exhibition vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable overrides," "says King, who himself made himself able to speak on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="17">There are already two to three per minute flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was with 77 mph kilometers in the tempo-30-zone on the road.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has been moved, it has become more quiet."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales in sales, everyone can look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the" end customer, "so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "most slight drop," "but also admits that" "course" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants were" hard hit. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about every euro turnover.</seg>

<seg id="33">"the road renovation took its operation" "for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to dismiss half of his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation with the advice, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER knows from other country circles, where so much more generous is handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all the suits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>

<seg id="2">"following the recent proposals, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does a Dulite status have to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Compromisers.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals were politically reasonable to the coalition partner," says the German Minister of Interior in the introduction of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They claim no one.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, further points would first be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"also, I took part in it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as Minister of Interior, he was placed on results and at a" "achievable consensus" "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière will have a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But this is all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some are already known, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement multiple EU guidelines on passenger information and truce law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière will start a second attempt for proposals not to be done with the SPD: he wants to recruit sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," "says the CDU man."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he does not consider this to be reasonable and also does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented to de Maizière too.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportation and more opportunities for detecting people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">"refugees, targeted at the country, should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for security checks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in case of cancellations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sacred.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also have an effect on unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated ones for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to argue that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"moreover, in view of the high refugee figures, many people were worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things, which the people deeply occupied, did not suffice to cling to election campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security is enormously put into focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are elections."</seg>
<seg id="35">"for this reason, the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking place in the issue of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high rise between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garrisome dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the council chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also arouses for irreconcilable sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a return from the double-pass, he doesn't hold anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have been talking about the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">Reviewing it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and with a ban on burka, he has constitutional complaints."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether his own package is constitutional in all corners, and whether it is" reasonable "for the coalition partner, must still be shown."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things to worry about.</seg>
<seg id="45">But even the SPD is trying to proactively shape itself on the topic of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before committing to the comment section to oversee it under the pseudonym non-allotment of men's middle ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the newness of physical objects but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely combating group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and ferment wildly before I stop, keep my hands and some determinations like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho slowly engages at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent salesmen were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I'm by Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three men middle-aged) into Reckless Records (numbers: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these vinyl records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy and buy items that he sold when he was young and ready."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70ies, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pump, people who heard about the comeback and prompted to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar soundscars, of objects that wake up happy rejoicing."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee is instigating a pile of records."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet stopped.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I was blowing through a pile of Bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle-aged), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came here and said:" I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead sound board so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-consuming, less music-like."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I don't have a turntable. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly enter."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged teenagers."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts novel synthesizer and sextet pop instead of experimental jazz drillers from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks particularly lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to find when you stand beside someone 30 seconds long."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannequin as a big shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of board lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression of pattern the jeans-pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors in reality, record shops and online forums exist."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the strolling through plates of the Berwick Street and the sheets by plates, while they avoid the stubborn view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who overlooks the shoulders of nothing strange men middle-aged."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses, in which individuals sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hairdressers, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that stores and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups cannot provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum causes for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure would be for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants held on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby in the final on Thursday evening came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of fijis when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji granted a master class in handling, side-quilting, backrest, line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost due to the not too bad comfort of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the strong defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks bounce from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving coaches. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau was overcovered in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a preparatory Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mount of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji only stopped."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jasa Veremalua put a touch down in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still available."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and closed the fijiyan gap... for four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the South seeinsulans whose fans sang and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire Fijis's playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame translated the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the fijis embraced and GB kicked annihilated in the grass."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in the past, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a short semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the bucks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotive gold than with these games and that wants what will mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which enter the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when she raced for the second Olympic old in two-wheeler without tax, the first women in the history of British sport that put on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter uncovered use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant Athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing, there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was more responsive than the coach who would survive 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term at all."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts came to Williams who spent a nerve-moving morning with a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan said," "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn't keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something rabbit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp to her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"for singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, senior citizens can make and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast in everyday life as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the common singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening of songs awakens many memories with older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia patients are sinking for long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people, who live alone, do not only focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I do something for a long time, I will be better and awoke beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby shouldn't hesitate - even if he thinks, have little talent, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear there when a sound is next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, it is easy to join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"whoever wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="15">"you go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombing raids carry the same signature," said Aregeneral Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express himself to potential motives - however, it is probably the case of the deeds of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern which is typical of the bombins of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks did not stand in connection with the Islamist uprising or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"instead, one assumes that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military junta."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">Still be unclear what group behind the attacks.</seg>

<seg id="30">"after conflicts between the security forces and the Muslim population, it is not necessary to get into these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) paid for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-cha-cha said that bombs were an attempt to stalk chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement of economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, retains itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympics or World records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam that it was no longer visible in the TV images."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte subsequently became the viral Internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his run with a recess of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old is still participating in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in subrepresented countries known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"because in ethopies most sportsmen run, Habte simply wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media marked it as "robel of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"referring to a" prosperity bump, "the English tabloid" The Sun "made it funny with" Dad Bod. ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he stroke only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played there no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani caused media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 metres of freestyle alone."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">"from October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic meter of waste water will amount to 3,44 instead of 2,10 euros for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3,44 instead of 2.26 euros (until now 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (up to now 2,18 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased again at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a racket calculation, the wastewater fee in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the permission of the householder was established by the Council of Agriculture in Kulmbach, that for these wastewater treatment plants."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost-covering."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallet."</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases lie between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as administrative leader Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, a new calculation of fees for wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period may also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded Schmidt in order to provide relatively small facilities with a very low waste-waste incinerator between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age of renovation and repair expenses, all three facilities were not least pleasing due to their age of renovation and repair expenses."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Azendorf plant is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf wastewater facility had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the pumping station Welschahl, the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and the first sewage sludge had to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge disposes of and an additional ventilation system to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" for these extraordinary expenses, the continued care and maintenance costs came into account, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made clear that in the case of low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were completely smashed.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt supplemented the market community of large entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already bordered to absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unclear, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages are sent to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past when they were accused of suggesting that the App Blackface promoted or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested some users a filter which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and enlightened cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" Yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies showed a greater problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and the indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat that it turned out the feature downlighted."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders, who have experienced rattle dism, recalled the filter to vulnerable clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others opted for the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely distributed across the photographs, that the filter was" vulnerable and the least unpleasant. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrasting of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not loosely secured, but that the yellow-face was dragged into the discarded extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapchats great audience of young people - who are different in the breed than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user, it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to erase her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that raced controversies reflect lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the large part white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat mostly left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual states of Congress had allowed the Congress to report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Army Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Defence Force, reports on great dissatisfaction among Central Command's intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically kicked off by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states could have allowed and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services," cited a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts face pressure from their predecessors, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts" "presented the report."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congressmen from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of Centcom reports are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence services to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrats in the committee, Adam B. Schiff, announced in a position. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Ship," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "harmed morals among analysts and" gave excessive room for differing opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House's intervention in the Centcom analysts regarding a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector who was accepted after complaints by Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the General Inspector's investigations were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also assumed that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "the investigations have reversed the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense)."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, as the former government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to make himself aware of the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker specifies that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there were no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these provisional refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger instruction, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead to.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising whirling through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places during the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team, began to turn things to a better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to rob the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and plunged the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the tournament for the US doorkeepers, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Same as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a rapid relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the olympic torch itself would be a burning stick, which is handed down from the wristguards to the swimmers to the triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn the TV, read a newspaper or listen when talking to your neighbors in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecker, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a woman's warm with dimples, could certainly have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-being TV ads when he would be a swimmers, gymnast, or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistols, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charms of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so scary perceived that many that I had asked, did not know that it is at all an olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider's charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has a humorous potential - the cartoonist tremor of its never-ending impact, but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline which means so much means "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling movements (turning, heck and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, you will be judged according to the performance, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the baseline, but also another height goal in the TV transmission: that of the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think about watching these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attacker and the objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters killed during the clashes with the police were killed during shootings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and spread in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the response of the government has been relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that policemen fired and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security professionals hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Committee is now calling for a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, while dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglasting in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after an extensive election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this undisputed, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been defeated more or less in recent years, protect the turbulence and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of biting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media, because cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government obtains access to Facebook and Twitter what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were so close to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since aeons, the Amharas, who come from eththopia predominantly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are in co-ordinating under a umbrella," "said Mulatu Gemmou, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, has been an Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in taking early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this basic fate," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which according to the statistics of analysts apparently pleaded by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and that time of turmoil passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misgivings of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters took place in Gondar, an ambush town, by Tigray, and hatred towards the tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for strongholds on the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently concluded that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile territory."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has founded ISIS "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump attempted to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification gave new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his comrades who endeavour to take care of it during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of which he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump retired regarding the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help weaken the statement, reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prasselt down on Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would suggest proposals to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism, when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clintons's emails, but later he explained," "Of course I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "according to how the reaction happens." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has received an even etching note since his survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a great lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump has generally tried to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellow comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocators, gave himself great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbanded, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being routed on each of his words and being preoccupied against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, twisted "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"its menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, schnaukellosem imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh salad with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter asked hackers, this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, Leberkäse and Bohnenbrot."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaply that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War." "a Square Meal" "draws the ways with which the country changed to be no longer the land of Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense theme," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"just as excited was the new budget: mysterious foods such as bread and water-nodules became staple food, the casserolle as a" wonderful way to recycle food residues, "Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely serene luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures have been tested because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfying appealed to taste or even healthy common sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at noon," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home business recipes.</seg>

<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household politicians "and the challenge to transform Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "a Square Meal" "is a feast of historic treats."</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-Cake-Essen-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant cuisine of his kitchen, he spoke like the millionful man of the world to whom he became."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was glorified in reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor would have asked him to statute an exmark with his stomach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland hai: the oldest cyclone is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haie comes up with up to 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland shark floats up at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal speeds up 2.6km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">This slowed lifestyle seems to be a treat for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland hai who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist presumed long ago, that Greenland haie will become stone age."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie is hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-pentagrus measures them when they equip six animals with a transmitter ahead of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the loot do this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and are looking for cadaver that torches from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haie who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetres measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lenticular core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably lots of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth, therefore, should lie in the early 1960s, when atomic weapons search for greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal in the length of 220 centimeters, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, which is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland hairs, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenticular core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Grönlandhai, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai-females get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length were able to assign an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haie with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This may also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusages live above all in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, an 211 year old Grönlandwal, where bacon on the neck had a 120 year old harpoon lace, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal stands at heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should be investing more in a long life on the other hand.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministries from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way for a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were met."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time up to the next RomWall trip of all the Ministers in the next two years, the OberministrantenRound St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and you finally decided to visit the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year's mercy was given to the mercy of the mercy on Fribourg's Münster cathedral, a special pilgrimage destination."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern went on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening, the pastor sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and told the pilgrims."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, he was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster's beloved wife stands and so the Pilgrimage was taken away from the Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"each day tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts in the morning and in the evening."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis, chapels or churches always made rest to sing together a song from specially organized pilgrim lyrics."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the nights, parishes of the local parishes were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and vigorous dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner shaved last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the Jumping and made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took sixth place in March at the World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hinder appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement testified a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the gravel that has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner placed an Olympic ord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he was barely back, but Kenny brought the team forward and skinned."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation to slow down in a higher gear to slow it down and to enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they stepped on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic ord and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kennys and Hoys, there were indications that after a weak start he intentionally dropped onto the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team for the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have so badly lost with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle of Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kennys, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would mean Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," I enjoy this only for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal race of the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to the finish in 3: 51,942. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought with officers before the qualification yesterday, when functionaries called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women competition tomorrow continued and finished, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong web wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a flock of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, Dramas played in the background, such as the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April, in the midst of sexism and moped penalties as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like the legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="1">The future of the smelting of Portland is questionable due to the abolition of the energy order</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supplier agreement and thereby elevates all delivery contracts, as the supplying energy company hurried."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy imposed for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk at a shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, shared that three more owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL still said that the contracts were called" "hedging business", "which should have entered into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month period of termination so that they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," said the current supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL receipts from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong retail prices for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL stated that the value of the contracts has already been written down in the amount of $187 million in the" "expectation of termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the smelting or to ensure power supply to the melting" "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation of why it has withdrawn from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [current market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as an electricity producer this would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Cardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the trademark ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me cry," "wrote Kendall."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scanned reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of her sister and that ends with a classical twist: they all have a surprise party planned."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this depicts the cliché-hairy plot of almost every birthday episode of a child's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought that we forgot you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a channel at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the Wälzers 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still leaking before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, the model "as" models that are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jennert's success does not like any success."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenninger's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the Mistakes of the Eye."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but on the miscarriage, it seems to pass the point."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes publicity for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successors now dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not well in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite a tapping."</seg>

<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, lovers can buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hanover as an "office in the west-pocket format."</seg>

<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price is quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will have 10,000 new apprentices alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>

<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be playing on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wronged in 2012 and they are also wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked to him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have chosen a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion invested infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequented catwalk of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="5">"a woman in the dark" "in an act of desperation" "on the street and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years, who was overhauled by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus probably was once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have once referred to similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggesting that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and still revolved slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host lives and protected it from faster evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously suspected by planets research."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once believed to be habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogene, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, the way we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of star, age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently attack companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware protection specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with Erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of malwarebytes toward attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially too high-pressure ransom can be significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently monitor a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most painting programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for unaltered files such as Word-, Excel, or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stilled."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: does not pay, it only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the light of downtime in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure inspected the user forces and contact with the users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims by chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt free sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people redeem payments of only a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate some hard and pay five-digit amounts to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software building kit to the actual Erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by the malware, providing advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The presser then searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set of a criminal and arranges another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent sense their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weep, member of the German Society for Schlafforgery and sleep medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands landring, however, is the insomnia, that is, one in and through sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just asleep, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleeping disorder is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is often frequent in depression," "says Wedel."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors would like to thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a disk failure, can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to salute about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"whoever does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised in the day should go to the doctor, betray woes."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: you are smitten, tired, uncomfortable, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve sleep disturbance, it is important to find out whose causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any sleep medicine in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first contact the specialist doctor, advises woes."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with research whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the sleep laboratory physician, for example, in snoring with breathing replacements, in case of sickness, insomnia or if one does not find the cause of sleep disturbance, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a midday sleep," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After the emplacement one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeder at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep."</seg>

<seg id="34">There are quite many screws where you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>

<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project, the area as a" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been cleared by 300 police officers, the police patrobed official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wagons on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visiting the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the house."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilee of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain vorm späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, a primary school and kindergartens are located."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main source of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are mainly generalized by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to bring about a majority of police protection from the vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between home occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which also today has a lower average income and high poverty rate compared to the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Rīga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalised in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and balers from all over the world over the past few years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at drawn sliced discs or freshly painted facades that were thrown into the bag.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours watch this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against police officers."</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes make property damage that tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant house for 17 years alongside the contentious 94, cannot be a question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be."</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will no longer give it any longer in the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here, one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately withdrawn into the Rīga Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for that reason, it was also so important that the natives get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the clearness over the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through historical buildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are, ultimately, condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well bettered," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>

<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find flats for the connection refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented flats.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Council's Office to Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search is very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"until now, it does not work until you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings must be replaced as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-Euro-jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no occupational therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean job.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it is just and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems, too, says the customer honestly," people with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do they have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," "what some naive might call". ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would bring them completely into call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in fact, it is unfair to place them helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbach are already busy to integrate the existing human beings wisely.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
