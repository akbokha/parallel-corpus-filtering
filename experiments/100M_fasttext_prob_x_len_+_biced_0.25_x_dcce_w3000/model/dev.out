Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as on T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the two further deterior@@ ated by the deal struck by Obama in order to deal with the Iranian nuclear programme .
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had refused it with regard to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , prof@@ essed to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told a somewhat delicate voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note p@@ opped on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee a guarantee for an automatic way to employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after escape from the campus , the police found lam@@ bs later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ yl Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb began in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education . &quot;
he did a doc@@ torate in the spring of Ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met with friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar . &quot;
he was the wom@@ en@@ ologist at that time .
&quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now living 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse working for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and m@@ outh@@ piece play in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign of anything that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the au@@ stri@@ a and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar programme and specialized in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemor@@ ative ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to set fewer workforce for the Christmas season
&quot; toys R Us says it will not stop as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently at him employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is drawing closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simulated seed and a length of arm from being away with the Princess of Wales by a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ str@@ it@@ edly the biggest time @-@ trip film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; ban on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving nuclear deals with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a breakdown .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks when asking down@@ wards , it has ( still ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin asking seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s stamina and begin to let their dollars flow in order to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Any@@ thing values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of ten re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only two out of ten say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing about excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the repub@@ lican voters say that they &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters of ten@@ ding Irish voters think that Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not go to the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their v@@ ows , Repub@@ lican voters consider Tr@@ ump to be real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination towards just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters look at Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps guidance , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump ear@@ ns majority support . &quot;
&quot; ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have fixed their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that and no one can really say , never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and fishing focus was in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ si@@ veness of Tr@@ ump is to stop crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Repub@@ lican Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; in the meantime , about half of the support of repub@@ lican voters falls to Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , above all due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ art Trail you find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a re@@ hom@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular positions one square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V@@ √∂lk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , mind . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich , on the other hand , is not at the top . &quot;
champ@@ ions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
double @-@ acher re@@ actor in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller gave the FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ √§us - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze described FC Bayern in the witch chain of Pi@@ raeus a dream start into the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and G@@ √∂tz@@ es hits ( 89@@ th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starting point in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where guar@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich at last . &quot;
&quot; in his 28 hit in the Champions League , M√ºller received good co @-@ service from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had happened to him as a f@@ lange of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm had promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based thought . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , including rep@@ utable clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 I stum@@ bled upon Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went to work courage@@ ously , but often too mer@@ cil@@ essly in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by le@@ ver@@ aging on left outside Douglas Costa , which in@@ frequently passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
M√ºller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , as the Olymp@@ us @-@ St√ºr@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct reference , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria with@@ drew its usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to set con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but on Tor@@ h√º@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; so , for example , when he turned a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the fa@@ der , was initially sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given green light after the final training , said sport manager Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something different is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by el@@ f@@ meter , M√ºller still sat on it . &quot;
in front of the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partially m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their viewers block apparently prov@@ oked the followers of host Pi@@ raeus , with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : in case of wai@@ ver the risk decl@@ ines quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the chance to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , about 2.5 to 3.6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; root causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to more frequent gum infections in smo@@ kers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment again fell to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared study director H@@ einer Boeing by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and containers , and according to our findings , it also leads to good dental health until high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study investig@@ ates the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across traces from the late Anti@@ quity to Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; for the repeated time , arche@@ ological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department of archae@@ ology for arche@@ ological monuments . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman died in the train station in the F@@ id@@ ler Circle , the Federal Police asks the people for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman crossed the railway station in direction to the railway station and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of M√∂n@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by cap@@ turing the train , she suffered severe injuries according to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated on the spot and taken care of rescue forces to a hospital .
&quot; on the basis of the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman , there are no evidence of the mid@@ d@@ ling function@@ aries . &quot;
the incident was perhaps observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; local residents or pass@@ ers from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Zi@@ egel@@ b@@ √§@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Stra√üe ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) occur . &quot;
&quot; information about the cause of the accident , can be given under the telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police service station under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station . &quot;
European Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the controversial private security facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds to more traditional dishes in its way of functioning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system which citizens dare to trust , &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m , Commissioner responsible for the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TTIP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ ages that the EU states and the US are jointly independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
&quot; so far , the proceedings were agreed among themselves on arbitr@@ ators , an objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , comm@@ enting Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
&quot; the Investor @-@ State Disp@@ ute Sett@@ lements ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of a parallel justice system , compl@@ ying with the company of damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , to leg@@ alize national laws or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; on the other hand , the German Economic Affairs Minister Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission included key points in the reform , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the Malm@@ str√∂m &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the charges of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , continued un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to stand at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
del@@ ic Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the inti@@ mid@@ ated fol@@ ks@@ cat@@ cher recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pin . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places , which he repeatedly records on the map , about his meticul@@ ously arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative mad@@ man . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs that nest@@ le harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can drift into the great opul@@ ent ones at all times . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a dead series : each of the 50 federal states should be defeated in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , Seven Sw@@ ans have already appeared and breaks down positively . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Lef@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide acclaimed masterpiece is released in 2005 . &quot;
super@@ imposed on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no list of entries from the influential music media .
&quot; after highly productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) , extensively electronic selling pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth decent studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs were desc@@ ended , the stage shows here become the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he is mainly presenting the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the wi@@ dened St@@ ev@@ ens gets back to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can therefore disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an enc@@ ore thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens modest , plays acousti@@ cally very few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been waiting for sus@@ pen@@ se since his election for the Prime Minister &apos;s frei@@ ghter .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n aims to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frei@@ ghter and for the first time to invest with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch . his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and following his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , is the focus of several page stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in resp@@ ectable silence &quot; &quot; and he accepted the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in economics , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour &quot; , &quot; following Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour MPs set out to remove the whole idea of limitation overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; is that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of ¬£ 26@@ ,000 to ¬£ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader over the dis@@ patch box in the Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire is too con@@ front@@ ational and that he will have to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; since it was first sent to television in 1990 , the delegation was viewed with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s objective target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and most advanced estim@@ ation of the time of interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a leap of 20 % after the tak@@ eover bid of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .

the head of JD Sports says higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power compens@@ ates the higher labor costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could make the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to Pot@@ ato D@@ √∂ner
potatoes or woo@@ fers ?
&quot; both - and indeed in the Pot@@ ato D@@ √∂ner , which the Oldenburg I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster using a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been brought to the patent office in Munich by the patent office .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;

met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches So@@ il Dis@@ ability campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - One
met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash launched a ground@@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and store shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and appliances performs its annual investment strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 per cent in eastern countries . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening his first markets in these two states and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in volumes on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business meeting in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash rejected it to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; i@@ gas market share has decreased by 18 percent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading supplied around 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operational debt reduction in simultaneous print on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler w@@ rest@@ les and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week to improve their stores with fast growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop remedi@@ ation programs will be set to ver@@ ve , and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; fell into the spotlight due to the in@@ famous confrontation between Kyr@@ gi@@ os and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have struck Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a Kr@@ amp@@ f tel@@ ei@@ pt a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am pretty much more intri@@ gu@@ ing about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he has been treated a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Cy@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ro &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight where he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary declares the emergency situation and sailed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with indign@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a helicopter ho@@ ver over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries must be held , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ day bloc in Brussels no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the super@@ imposed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put up its hopes for an immediate action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency situation in two southern regions gave authority more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen hundreds of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people caught trying to cross the border , 15 others had already gotten deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of pun@@ ishing crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos envel@@ op@@ ed the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; the former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race to nom@@ inate at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to face . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders ranked second with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can@@ di@@ cts for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ er of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders posted some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage in men and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support for men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders here is only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
but Clinton still has a big advantage in older voters .
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them , because they are the candidate . &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly Clinton &apos;s current supp@@ orter is especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election say that Clinton would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton , fewer Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orter is asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the vulner@@ ability are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections would like to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic constitu@@ ents are asked by the pre @-@ election , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
Clin@@ tons supporters say more than half that bi@@ ds would have their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if bi@@ ds do not opt for the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; cho@@ osen &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call on questions about elec@@ tiveness . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate of the pre @-@ election campaign is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; among the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot;
&quot; democratic constitu@@ ents of the pres@@ election generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic constitu@@ ents have no view of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the Pres@@ idential elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of ten , who say that Clinton &apos;s views are worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is seen by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights represented nationwide also Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , have good notes in leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut the best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample sample of 351 democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Repub@@ lican voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son fired up from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ therine , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample sample of 3@@ 76 people of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in surveys - he ends up with 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also revealed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump has found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; even if peak values are only measured in distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bathroom in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) with a maximum of 18 degrees .
&quot; in contrast , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch college newcom@@ er charged
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder is filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood interven@@ ed brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members , U@@ ten@@ sil , began hiding and presented the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy , den@@ g was repeated with mu@@ te force injuries on the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the chic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the first five members of the Third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold this to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community . &quot;
this will happen when F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a raise of interest comes , and the hou@@ sen@@ ess will fall into bank@@ rupt@@ cy , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could however find that all excitement was exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets from 12 to 24 months are stran@@ gled after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st in a recent study on what happens after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to rise later in the In@@ cre@@ asing cycle and the return to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could speed up a recession . &quot;
most remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in case of a zinc increase .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , in the case of the 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raises the question of &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have prepared a tribute to the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all In@@ cre@@ ase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing swing in GDP , and before rec@@ essions were soon put into the shadows at the beginning of recovery , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that bonds are faster than with stocks when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the margins seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the In@@ cre@@ asing cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to the return of returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the big and whole , companies that engage the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive in the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares are inclined to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; outside of the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; Spar@@ er could see gains by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives member of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster on account of his &quot; &quot; mu@@ til@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the voice of The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading MP and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sellers do not . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public law radio &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC General Director dism@@ issed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the choice of culture , media and sports under fire to kick off the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million ¬£ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced on special BBC way .
&quot; he added , he wants the company &quot; &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s the next time an entertainment series star@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee ear@@ ners for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose in August the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the recordings began in 2000 . &quot;
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has bra@@ ked the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping was bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into the gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is happening , and we may experience that the growth will be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decl@@ ining revenues . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers are holding their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers visited their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers fell off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the purch@@ as@@ ers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from doing shopping . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that ¬£ 5 was spent slightly more than 1 ¬£ online .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 deaths are borne by Muslims in the first burial places in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse partly to the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane rus@@ hed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the victims who were killed when a crane to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather collap@@ sed .
&quot; gri@@ eving filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to declare their respect when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ is@@ s@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the proc@@ ession went over to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane was over@@ thrown by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of Bin Laden due to the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , handed a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dec@@ ors who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the big central mo@@ zh@@ ee Mec@@ kas were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group , said to have not had the arm of the crane to steal when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was v@@ owed to reveal what was causing the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a large mos@@ que court , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims face the H@@ add@@ sch , which is taking place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ elled the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ kas Gro√ü@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been connected with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and has acquired major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dis@@ sident son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed by the family in the 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; government officials decre@@ ed that 1 million ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other injured receive half of this amount .

&quot; V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the nursery chain , said that a large rise in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , has meanwhile out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops which are aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , who do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that holds exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial position . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and turnover after the group failed to pay the costs of closing the shops .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ whether due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of office .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the defend@@ ants were used for private purposes in 2006 to 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he damages the damage with approximately 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact ex@@ pi@@ red the chairman of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence proved that at no time an asset appeared to the association . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries had only charged expenses for expenses and the sports club , for whom they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we further or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the accused , one of the accused , told large @-@ scale inspec@@ tors of the financial office . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , laid out our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to pay any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial - success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses for expenses incurred by 1991 has been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one has paid out some of the expenses for expenses only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore also l@@ ump sum and not detail entries appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us directors jointly managed the two defend@@ ants , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the society was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial crisis , but it was important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigation began due to abuse of office , an amount of 120,000 Euro was transferred to the Club &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were set@@ backs , declared the defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this paper account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why dem@@ ol@@ ish compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association was never damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With whom you are all out of the tailor . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he had never bought a cent salary , he only charged the mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he charged EUR 1,000 per month in di@@ ets , but the actual cost was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were unable to show precise documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept after an audi@@ ting , in which everything was considered correct , they declared . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter money also referred to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all Beh@@ eb@@ ungen are in cash , with which he has to go to Blei@@ burg from his hom@@ etown to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard adds another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the workforce breakdown that has been running for three years , the computer giant will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions at the U.S. computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to break down from 25,000 to 30,000 places in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of USD 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company divided on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special strain of around $ 2.7 billion that will fall from the fourth quarter .
&quot; the ongoing reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the 2013 / 14 fiscal year . &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Share gave 2.3 percent .
&quot; the company , with printers from California Pal@@ o Alto , currently spl@@ its up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC market , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers in accordance with its services , continued the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the fiscal year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to the change in the industry with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only been re@@ acting late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more business online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 vac@@ ancies . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat acts in Iraq would mainly come against rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
61 per cent is positive that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 per cent is to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of the respon@@ dents declined by 20 per cent . &quot;
29 percent could not decide .

a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police line a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water@@ shed .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially set an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn a little back .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees came together and suffered under difficulty .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists survey@@ ed by Reuters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 per cent will be held . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been on zero . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the evidence suggests that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 pm CET on Thursday

&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shocked and killed his colleagues , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; &quot; reported authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency phone number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , He shot a man and killed anyone . &quot;
lamb spoke to the staff of the emergency call centre that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb took 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were killed . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that she was married about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , which is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when they caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb was driving his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 as his lifetime on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa to build the Group
Lufthansa plans a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group . &quot;
&quot; however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union . &quot;
Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings of low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a governing board for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings to compete with the Group in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of annual revenues of ‚Ç¨ 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the Tari@@ ff Agreement with the Cock@@ pit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the succ@@ essi@@ vely stri@@ pped strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; will result as quickly as possible results . &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the interim supply of pilots , the background is the saving concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
it fores@@ ees that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors has moved to the company &apos;s own picture line Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside def@@ ender to the we@@ eping and closing it out of play for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H√©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w burst into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double bone structure and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
he had an oxygen mask in the locker room .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the suspension of an i@@ vory .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ vory and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was saying , &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad at that . I am so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost out@@ war@@ dly . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph where Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead repe@@ ating an index of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets his desire to see a real tree , is met . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reading like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment by the money @-@ gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , Th@@ need stri@@ cken entities , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR mission was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s constitu@@ ency office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res which England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a backward win .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid himself , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving England &apos;s test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully suggests other runners for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not perform such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test hit gets to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th received seven chances , like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine . &quot;
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist that I treasure high .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge seat , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends naturally on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and receive four Qu@@ icks , appeared and I didn &apos;t do anything about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed musician has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
he immediately made three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est cores of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not employed at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;

such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy until 2017 comes into a F@@ lau@@ te
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper and deeper each day , even without the choice of ingen@@ ious Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is severely de@@ pressing for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at re@@ affir@@ med that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contractual changes that they most often don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if they thre@@ aten social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes to see Britain in the inside of the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande faces his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even plan not inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ten@@ ant &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press room , as they did not during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember very weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 years . &quot;
&quot; in all his mad@@ ness , Ed had known Mili@@ band who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who own most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about her , but he noticed that when sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , an error then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
he says we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional leaf cement tendency and the wil@@ der favor of Tor@@ ny &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; in all circumstances - Benn@@ ett expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ members and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their clause on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the media campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not launch a campaign for withdrawal - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin cause political capital , - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday of something which was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report of Public Health England about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month grab@@ bed the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; , &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ level decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he has received after reports beforehand by the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the Tab@@ ak Line of P@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there is no evidence that &quot; there has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die each year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by providing clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should quit East@@ bourne says former boss of Channel 4
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making publicly @-@ legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would be clearly demonstrated by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcasting fees , which I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , one should at least give it to programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed which could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ bourne is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for that . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series who conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault on the hunt for reviews is &quot; due to the ambi@@ tions of the people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comment@@ aries on BBC &apos;s most popular shows announce that which the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ er@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ enders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche @-@ programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , where one can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these organic programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , think all of us think that you get a great value for ¬£ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for ¬£ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain the public broad@@ c@@ aster television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms of which he said that only a handful on television will be shown , and to make alli@@ ances with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers in order to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically altered nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultr@@ asonic waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound but chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into worms . &quot;
ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ ions tr@@ aps TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when using ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around advertising for the tru@@ ce fair - through a lead of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid .
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic display of company advertising , but &quot; due to the da@@ zz@@ ling with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a stri@@ de of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy dis@@ comforts of others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely horri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ew : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ter where you &apos;re in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like , unlike those you would not speak to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
allow people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ t received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from r@@ api@@ dity - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closed by baking .
&quot; as you begin the Uni at the climax of back @-@ man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got something baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a permanent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when they kno@@ ck . &quot;
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with them as my ro@@ ommate who added their milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the right to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it &apos;s three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbours sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour examination . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly enter the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be so aw@@ k@@ ward embarrass@@ ing if you are holding a ro@@ ommate for your future marriage partner to dis@@ connect and then see them every day and perhaps witness how she pul@@ ls out all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give a valuable and am@@ using lesson through hiding - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you will then put into the freezer - but do not tie up your poss@@ essions on the ceiling more than twice .
&quot; town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , sole educ@@ ators , &quot;

&quot; thus , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the mother and the poor . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build better and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner atten@@ ds to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for men remain to a great extent here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution . &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 3 ) 3,@@ 8@@ 64 6@@ 19 Happy Bir@@ th@@ day New@@ by ! ! ! &quot;
it makes integration easier .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of living .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are built just in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to the individual needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 3 ) 3,@@ 8@@ 64 6@@ 19 Happy Bir@@ th@@ day New@@ by ! ! ! &quot;
especially complicated it is always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the position regulation .

how did the residents react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating lux@@ uries for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but don &apos;t you ti@@ ghten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother or the poor . &quot;
I would like to show you how to build a cheap and good building today .
that &apos;s why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple &apos;s update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; it may be easier to delete apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this when using a special tool , to delete apps , and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the telephone may switch to half way and this could lead to a break@@ up of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full Attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton only one motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start in the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup two stressed that I didn &apos;t have anything to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in front of the post race in Singapore on this Sunday from title def@@ enders and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .

&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still un@@ clear .

Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ b√ºro seeks direct contact
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ isti@@ ft Alten@@ Centre have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation , and a new start @-@ up point was opened at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Platz . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls down from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ cian &apos;s office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , right next to the shopping market , from now on , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seeking information on questions such as care insurance or services of health care products . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often caring relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the B√ºrger@@ sp@@ ital , as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Amadeus &quot; is also not in@@ frequent . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; for the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both executives take a look at the demographic change . &quot;
this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , as under@@ lined Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inaugur@@ ation ceremonies , the Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ b√ºro also dedic@@ ates itself to the association &apos;s association with the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite to a regular soci@@ able side @-@ together . &quot;
&quot; this makes the social foundation a big contribution , that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible . &quot;
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ b√ºro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days between 10 AM and 12 PM . &quot;

he died on 5 September at the age of 92 as the K√ºnstler@@ haus hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
&quot; with M@@ ang , the K√ºnstler@@ haus awarded a hon@@ orary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the exterior . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mu@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mu@@ enster . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ane , followed by the police to his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the altitude of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young people , and struck them with their fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nos@@ eb@@ ral and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left off his sacrifice . &quot;
the injured young man was now brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and drove past several times there .
&quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured left the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
&quot; taking the help of a stroke , one ta@@ sted on the face and th@@ ig@@ h of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
&quot; up to now , only a v@@ ague object description is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second r@@ ack@@ et was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was cloth@@ ed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank M√ºller to take over the field of Fel@@ steh@@ aus and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus .
&quot; also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank M√ºller will take over the practice of Fel@@ stand@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ain@@ aus@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will follow his successor in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , M√ºller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ stra√üe 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing her professional training at the Golden Hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just inv@@ oked them . &quot;
the couple M√ºller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to dwell in the Vil@@ sen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; Frank M√ºller also grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover and in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed head physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness br@@ ittle @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ aus@@ ausen works as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( boarding ) has specialized in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the garbage , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EK@@ Gs and need an intercom more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ P is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , the garbage can be subsi@@ dis@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; emphas@@ ises Saturday Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2000 patients come to the field of rock breaks every quarter , in the North German A@@ verage Practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor has found itself , it would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits M√ºll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , also still looks especially familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the medi@@ cs have practiced for 30 years there . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel said , smiling . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly felt it after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot;
&quot; their husband adds : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could become different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also passed on to our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants a asylum application can do this as a matter of course . &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would leave future refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ in wants to do not seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees would have already tried to arrive in the night hours on Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police was able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , ever since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles meet with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do that , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were on the road all night away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres from Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually result in a postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ situated route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
observe strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country as regards the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to slip behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; Wednesday , Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
it would not be very high refugee figures at the moment .
&quot; one cannot say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are subscri@@ bed to Croatia . &quot;
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of providing insights into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der transactions should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were reported to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be tr@@ apped , &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the trials against 32 more accused in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sun and in the middle of four large tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe dealt with this action on her 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; the head of ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice assistance is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by , as well as for questions and talks , such as the hon@@ orary staff . &quot;
&quot; while some pass@@ ant spontan@@ eously comes to the chal@@ k and the sentence to &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; can read &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others stay briefly , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the fr@@ inge , little discussion of the action on itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only if I realize that for me at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supports the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , it is understandable that not everyone on the tables wanted to tell us publicly , but finally it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open up . &quot;
an estim@@ ation that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid divi@@ des .
the death and mour@@ ning companion belongs to the hon@@ orary staff of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe looked for volunteers by inv@@ oc@@ ation , she immediately reported and had been involved in the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Sankt Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , hold it for precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning chap@@ er@@ one .
every two years training is offered for new employees .
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;

&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;

&quot; the smaller view comes in spite of the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ - transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;

&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex has earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , almost behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks questioned analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought the turnover in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results from Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while earnings declined because of higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;

&quot; on the most awa@@ ited conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strateg@@ ies spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the loan for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at one end of the en@@ chan@@ ted , two @-@ story sitting hall , there is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold contract from the Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate may be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented interest rates since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it is growing solid , recent turbul@@ ence on global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest of federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently survey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted a rise in interest rates this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets , however , expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promise that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average value increased by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the set up this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm down the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a raise of interest would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , it would expect an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although creating jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , while the Dow is now around 10 % below the May market . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be taken into account in terms of decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormous . &quot;
&quot; the mere mention of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow down &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered del@@ usions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , has opted for a zinc increase , quoted in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower their loans by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest , because the markets are ex@@ iting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / stock is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the entire shopping basket is hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the coff@@ ers and has different taking options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat bar is extensive , as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the bar will clean and filter the fish and even fry on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department . here you will find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ ing , whole du@@ cks , fish , bark blu@@ t and g@@ all , pig @-@ natural dar@@ m , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide ais@@ les are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian beside the cas@@ hier .
&quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , on the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot;
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own park area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany this day .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still fond of her 74 les@@ ions .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er home at Dill@@ inger Stra√üe .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of the lessons is different than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women in shock@@ ing ways how important good nutrition during lac@@ tation is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ campus is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously secured without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the committee had also decided to submit an application for a &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid cultivation plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission of a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ tig first and roof over@@ stand &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of the planning is to use the roof area for solar installations : &quot; &quot; this way we get together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot;
&quot; in the event of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof incl@@ ination that is supposed to be different from energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
this reduces the volume of the hall considerably .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the cultivation plan not &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; with regard to the roof @-@ slope - whereby the Bern@@ ards municipal council usually passes more restri@@ ctive when it comes to liber@@ ating applications . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project when it comes to gymn@@ as@@ tics : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ band promotion .
&quot; in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now submitted to the Council of Agriculture . &quot;
Klinik Pei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from Pei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is seen by the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the postpon@@ ed Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the almost 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ √üen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now switched to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take charge of the management from October 1 , and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in p@@ ac@@ emaker and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inner station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years Fischer will be with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to the two houses until next year the former hospital of the jail , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ √üen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours about what the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü could not say there were several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which had been received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as chief physician for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the Pei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) was once again threatened by closure over the past few decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the palms of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC evening ( 20.@@ 3 pm ) .
&quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce exists . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the Bad@@ ens received a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and have taken some protection there . &quot;

two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon by shots .

&quot; a crime suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , has fallen victim to violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a twenty @-@ year @-@ old 20 @-@ year @-@ old who report@@ edly conf@@ essed the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the bodies . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning , after they did not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met with personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ ses were found .
&quot; the det@@ ain@@ ees were reported to the authorities in the police inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the cor@@ p@@ ses were put in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the twenty @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead . &quot;
the decision on the near@@ er circumstances of the act should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since started .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Soci@@ etal Housing Construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , there will be 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with there are 14@@ 0,000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency shelter . &quot;
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is pushing for a housing deficit , which is getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , some 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , compl@@ ained Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals were therefore living in large cities in flat @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the fi@@ sts on the housing market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the real estate tax could be abandoned and the land will be suspended for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for refugees from the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received in cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been accessed on Monday evening with 184 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could be even increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up Cor@@ ridor
&quot; there is virtually no escape to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose their way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television broad@@ c@@ aster RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the previous day .
&quot; new laws that came into effect on the same day , moreover , make common asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees go .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained , &quot; You can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t meet border guards . &quot;
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; however , after the closure of the border , hardly more refugees arrive after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the closure on Monday , there were only 93@@ 80 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the Grenz@@ z@@ a@@ us as a crime .
&quot; in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
the sentenced thre@@ aten sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - most important transition of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deport@@ ed there .
only a few hundred refugees assembled in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left the road@@ side in the last weeks .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express themselves to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government figures . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , small groups of refugees met regularly on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with ti@@ dying after the bridge on Sunday , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein End , &quot; said Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we left the un@@ inten@@ tioned guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE in a regional train to Pass@@ au , to try it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany but still over the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was put down at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ festival with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably soci@@ able , day before a two bridge sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n is now sending further tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping the R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke camp immediately to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and openly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , to make decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 ber@@ ths &quot;
Konrad has all the hands to do with refugee support .
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has set up the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen Bank to set up lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the First Dep@@ u@@ ction Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless anymore in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the housing of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without great confusion , said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master power . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 properties have to be found over the next few weeks - 20,000 the countries are supposed to provide 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied about how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum @-@ coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that quarters have to hold a certain height of the towel rail or the size of the superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in opposition to the Interior Ministry , he is based on Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the republic , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
&quot; so far , the search for lod@@ gings has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; first of all , no opening of municipal sports hall and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for housing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the parties are currently unable to accommodate these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations are to be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not the case . &quot;
other districts have to make their contribution here .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) has been acting on Monday for further action in the refugee question . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special moves with refugees in Germany .
&quot; however , the search @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger , Austria is now also a logical consequence of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ anlagen is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be hired for young , innovative companies out of the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New ship@@ yard and later also to acquire .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; D in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metre remaining area in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened a second store in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now has grown in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before that , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long thought about whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Vene@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the grand space of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been given birth by her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the specialist woman cannot answer with the last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag utili@@ zes each outfit .
the T@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this feature also connects some people with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether he expresses himself alien@@ ally , journalists or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy is revealed - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire descend . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair@@ style hair@@ style is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ stra√üe .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to him about -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ stadt shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous young@@ sters , among which besides Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for hum@@ ility , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts there .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the k@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the An@@ ders , tells her . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a site for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company was first real estate investment in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was with@@ drawn without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
&quot; crude is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally pointed statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and challenged the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the uphol@@ stered , this is not so lik@@ eable , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American more dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so burning . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; says the 72 year old . &quot;
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter said that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this from Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not wish the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who were in the US at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ at@@ ograp@@ hers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens . &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the Today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with today &apos;s 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today there was a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August , today , Today achieved an average of 3@@ 18.@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering whether Thom@@ son could have a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 44@@ 6.000 people . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident , that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m. &quot;
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret unveiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly apparently who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The bach@@ el@@ or eventually lands , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows the day before three are going to check , you may acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly recognised - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed Sam@@ s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought it was all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when asked , whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl equally - it &apos;s a decision between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the bach@@ el@@ or will be broadcast on wed@@ n@@ esday , 19 : 30 o &apos;clock . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a blast as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by league converter at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t @-@ return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly at his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers sports repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble , and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not introduce himself to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a tro@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free voters are calling for the adjustment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures .
&quot; at the beginning of the FW @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt , party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art parliamentary group vent@@ ures to Friday in the Francon@@ ian Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were envis@@ aged . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject will over@@ lap the exam , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there was during the Yugoslavia war in the ninet@@ een se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters as fast as possible .
&quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum set@@ ters , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW boss critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we needed uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot;
&quot; Bayern postpon@@ es , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to be more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ standing continuous burner is on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus , &quot; where an extension of the secondary intermediate level of three to four years has been tested . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss . &quot;
&quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high schools , who want to do so . &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

&quot; according to the &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies are missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;

&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; worked on the weekend . &quot;

4 People killed after police shooting footage on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police explo@@ ded rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Leader of the District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside of a police station , casting some of you stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before returning to rubber @-@ fin .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known , that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal on southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ ists say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ator voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re @-@ built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ meter area .
&quot; a mix of trade , trade and living - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meters property in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor is going to inqu@@ ire is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were signed . &quot;
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner of Great Street , already purchased a few months ago and let it be torn down on it . &quot;
H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plant@@ ations for the cottage settlement at the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
a number of investors are still worried - they fear the sale of their Freizei@@ fu@@ gi@@ um
&quot; months behind closed doors were negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday cottage near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interested party , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends passed on to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in discussion for months .
&quot; fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners , who came to the meeting , sum@@ med up the images and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea bree@@ der and member of the Board of Inter@@ ests of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like several other project critics that the traffic will increase strongly due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; all bus loads must come so that this pays off , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , who want to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of the donation call on its blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally accumulated donations will be doubled to a value of ‚Ç¨ 5.5 million to ‚Ç¨ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA &apos;s surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to minimize the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies have been conducted in people who are hospit@@ ably obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved completely and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , does not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was with obes@@ e people who under@@ went an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think that we wait too long before we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have strongly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
&quot; it is a theme that is currently more observ@@ able in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular in school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently released novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is delighted that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence , and also comm@@ enting George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and revealed that the violent response of the US made a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zer , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years reported that the toxic@@ ity control centres reported from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only drink because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens supposedly have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants mixed with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive frag@@ rances of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive for children . &quot;
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year old girl , who recently took four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry sm@@ elling tra@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought to treatment in an emergency . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk with an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency physician who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by alcohol and had kick@@ ed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; staff of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as a drug . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York State planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by laying out anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to tra@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their space .
&quot; the police survey@@ ed the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; sh@@ atter &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in case of a coll@@ ision on the cross column between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and On Her@@ es , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old motor@@ ist was easily injured during a car@@ p accident . &quot;
&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove along the cross @-@ sp@@ ange towards the industrial area , and it was too late that two previous vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he boun@@ ced into the rear of an audi@@ bus with his truck and pushed this vehicle to an earlier Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the accident involved vehicles , Sach@@ ertor@@ te was formed of about 10 000 Euro , the police dealt with . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer driving and had to be tow@@ ed .

the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bor@@ es Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former ranking mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
you are talking about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man Aber@@ deen , who now has five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly the way - but we have to continue .
&quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful with January transfers

&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; the players who come in the summer , have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season . &quot;
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is increasing . &quot;

&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau of National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available than seats , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery taking place to decide who is elected . &quot;

&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; it could have been better formulated , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to leave the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a house c@@ emet@@ ry incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape to them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race straight away .
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , claiming that she launched a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ ort probe at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had taken back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to be &quot; &quot; seen as too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go around with a raised head , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; prior to that , Moo@@ dy had taken the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly stick to their n@@ oses , because they have failed in the attempt to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it will be personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L become cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the trainer have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching carried out that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ sh@@ aken Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , marked the race day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which was contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has mistakenly carried slu@@ dge on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day as it was .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver &apos;s flight arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a coll@@ ision with a cycl@@ ist and driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ urg . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man came from Nath@@ alia of the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to be charged due to driver @-@ cur@@ sed and lower assistance and because of other traffic lights .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ urg , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable condition . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm player &quot; Ring@@ fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the attack lim@@ b of his crew , saying that they were only concentrating on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added , that the cri@@ tique of two leading coaches at his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s up and down again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ els when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus and this has provided the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock to him . &quot;
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team in 2010 , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a dirty trick . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play it and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and no d@@ ots do something exciting ? &quot;
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that in one stage we will meet them . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team was free on this weekend , because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Serbian with 200,000 ‚Ç¨ Dep@@ o@@ sit on Dru@@ gs &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the caf√© could have been of a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape in Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in common to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ ent statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damages , under the conditions that he withdraw@@ s his Australian and his Serbian passport , det@@ ects himself daily with the police and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house breaks apart
&quot; in a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks participated in a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried to ev@@ ade , at the last moment , to turn left , like the police . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ caused accident broke apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a loss in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone when she was asleep , went to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alert her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police looked around and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches &quot; , &quot; which used terms for searching for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then asser@@ ted that he did it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction to fri@@ ghten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , asking him to send more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was ill in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and we@@ eping .
she then also saw the im@@ pending images on the phone and faced the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and play@@ station used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have taken in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before the Court on 24 March this year . &quot;
advoc@@ acy advoc@@ ate Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; was found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael concludes the judgment until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual crimes before the date of judgment .
tractor switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up apart from the large control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers caused fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure of people increased in smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ person of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn Land@@ circuits along the river river Inn . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and bar@@ racks on the German side .
they are accepted by the Federal Police and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich Main Station , after the start of the German Federal Police Administration , more refugees arrived on Wednesday in comparison to the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone up to 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : clust@@ ering of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of Stur@@ mb@@ √∂@@ en in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot marine air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart divided . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous low is the dro@@ ple@@ t of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; who had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the last few days . &quot;
fierce storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden in particular .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , on Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ sea @-@ circle with goats from 60 to 90 km per hour . &quot;
on Friday the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accoun@@ ted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot;
the Opel Astra is one of the largest premier@@ es for the German automotive industry .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; so that the volume model is well sold , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an introduction below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be up next to the Astra at the IA@@ A still on new compact cars ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor M√©@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he is also a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan window wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 which is visible at the IA@@ A .
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ √´@@ n @-@ ab@@ leg@@ ger installed above all hand on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch@@ screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class , or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I , were added to the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the law enforcement agency Te@@ gel , who was accommod@@ ated for months in a too small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected may even hope for money if they were confined within confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open foot , had been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his inc@@ eption was due to the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the State of Berlin .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for renewed scrut@@ iny . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of detention for the compensation are decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was called . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of dent@@ s@@ ements .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; so they spoke only in April to a prisoner of damage , because he was locked up naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy is , according to a decision of 2011 , also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing for a prisoner in a Par@@ allel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in the last few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore imprisoned again and again in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness climbs , even to bats , it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; after information from the Jus@@ tiz@@ enship Office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of im@@ balance , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed each year - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 25@@ 0000 apartment ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially in paid rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing is out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute , there is much too little to arise : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal Ministry of Education are unanim@@ ous that there will be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether to find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , a political turn@@ around was given : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residential light , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to a residence . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking in German language .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is the K√∂nigs@@ weg path to work integration in the view of Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; Berlin School Administration has found that only a few parents fled their children into the kit@@ os , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ rooted parents it is only once very important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ≈Ç@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes manu@@ als in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators is growing strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared for classes without knowledge of German language . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin School of Education . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stu@@ dying refugees &quot; &quot; could be facilit@@ ated by the university entrance . &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or de@@ fam@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to asylum seek@@ ers law if they start studying .
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not get a b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be able to be B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this range short@@ ens to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , says Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should get b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art law will continue to develop into a new state religion . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant them certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to leave such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is urgent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a universal gender equality law - as a result of European decisions . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder rate showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrants and stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans claim for a long time , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention Deutschland commit , must become a reality in the coming years when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees waiting to date , says doctor president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for some power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to all newcom@@ ers , can be ordered directly at the registration of health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be rep@@ lic@@ ated with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to collect as many people with the limited power catalogue , which envis@@ ages asylum seek@@ ers law . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , doctors mainly make the language barrier possible . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more badly informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , she demands . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general emergency situations in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; in refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated han@@ di@@ caps , and in the young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other disease pictures German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect &quot; . &quot; and as for the health of the doctors , the refugees may even be reli@@ eved of relief . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly again ex@@ ert ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill , according to estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; especially vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by TU Munich proves that each fifth Syrian refugee camp is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , warmth and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , severe trem@@ bling and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill seek@@ ers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group to captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst opens into the Man@@ ege on the brick kil@@ n to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ ly staged .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift to the Inspir@@ er lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their everyday bank@@ rupt@@ cy and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the cub@@ an duo will easily record it . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast shall conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act of flair and artic@@ ulation . &quot;
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
fascinating and terri@@ fying at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations . &quot;
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each car@@ ving unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be retri@@ eved from the eyes as possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
the first commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is sure , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst , from 17 to 20 September , invites you to your performances every day at 5 pm and 8 pm . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also sad@@ dened by alleg@@ ations by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with voice calls .
&quot; last month , they had du@@ b@@ bed him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , who warned them to b@@ other Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members affected that immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is concerned about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard to reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction will result in a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenues and &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the place of birth of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the transfer from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC maker and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation follows plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; he said . &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period of time , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H√©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta start to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a little break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to come forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ating effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3,@@ 2 measured on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by far @-@ reaching hope , with his management to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Fe@@ ast : the comedy show which gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now even more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever , how suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men prevent from seeking help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can &apos;t really buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football watch in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often lag behind to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone couns@@ elling he explained to me : &quot; &quot; my audience role for people who feel de@@ pressed and threatened with suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone can help people in moments of despair also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest to celebrate the day totally re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ √∂ .
&quot; in his debut in the Champions League , di Maria will meet on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass over to Malm@@ √∂ . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ bu@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master onto the path , but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally increased her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball@@ point at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris requires a strong start against Swedish champion , as they asp@@ ire not only to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I &apos;m sorry that we didn &apos;t have one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which last weekend was a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ √∂ , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ app &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes got up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and out of the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could hold low before sub@@ stitutes Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi have ended up a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , age Har@@ ei@@ de , stated that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not sufficient . &quot;
hats off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion $ by share sales
&quot; based in Switzerland , mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , who is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , accumulated 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday as part of its huge debt recovery plan . &quot;
&quot; registered in London , Gl@@ enc@@ ore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion ¬£ in order to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and is devastating to markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the volume of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shares to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing track on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns relating to long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; the Chinese president , Xi Jin@@ ping , will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , xis first official in Washington , takes place on September 25th and re@@ jects President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosts of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan at a state d@@ iner , after the two leaders have led bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President xis visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi have the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit first was announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before going to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi addressed a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car .
&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured . &quot;
&quot; the damage will be estimated to 40,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago , prior to the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four time Champions League winners , twice a World Champion , twice a World Champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was standing before the 2008 Good@@ bye to Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM .
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns season 2008 / 2009 would have been running with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria above the entire distance on the lawn , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal class triumph at the end . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film editing
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she will not be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , experienced actor Brown under@@ pinn@@ ed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s selected screen@@ play . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; Brown said at first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , which is beaten by her white cat . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film , Dam@@ on said that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter came across a country @-@ wide effect and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to command discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured content . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox News @-@ personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , is un@@ clear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowned first champion
&quot; professional sports climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the finale . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete , who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought win , still under shock over the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates about it any more .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received numerous awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac would have felt the same , if they had exchanged the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been renewed for an eighth season , the shooting will start in the spring of 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins shifted a chance to climb within a game @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Sel@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strong , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first races since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; &quot; said pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back@@ fire at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks achieved a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second b@@ az@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the lef@@ th@@ and Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who caught a Two @-@ Run away to the right @-@ handed bre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen achieved the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was hitting a Double Play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit joins a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ h@@ anders st@@ ach S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three of us in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been kn@@ itted from the game of the injury list after he had been missing more than one month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush handed over a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; on the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third b@@ az@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big hit , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the S@@ hou@@ l@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since the middle of August on the injury list because of a shoulder @-@ pull , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted from the list of injuries to start against T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he was missing on the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the most lively people should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden ex@@ erts on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State capital have been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in H@@ esse , responsible for the initial intake of the government pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency accommodation in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria . &quot;
&quot; I believe the resol@@ ute reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states &quot; collective for@@ ego@@ ing . &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military participation in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controlled on southern and eastern borders
&quot; according to Germany , Austria also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , but no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
even Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
they did not call them concrete figures and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann asked for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had passed on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis so far . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees in a special meeting on Tuesday , 22 September . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the initial absorption and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel s@@ under@@ ed , those people who need protection , they also prof@@ ess this . &quot;
&quot; but who does not have a lead , can &apos;t remain in Germany either . &quot;
this conception was clearly divided in the round .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , thousands of desperate refugees are stuck in the Balkans . &quot;
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to seal off the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , thousands of other migrants report@@ edly went on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; takes the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean s@@ ails . &quot;
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
so the moon mil@@ dly stag@@ gers on its way around the ring plan@@ ade .
&quot; although this exchange rate is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; technical sheet .
&quot; for a long time , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; thus &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ Moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of the Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least on the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 M√ºnchen several weeks
1860 M√ºnchen has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation into an investigation .
R@@ ama had already su@@ ed pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis means &quot; four weeks of forced breaks . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; said sport director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a mer@@ cil@@ ess pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a train@@ ee , the Six@@ ties initially presented a Def@@ en@@ siv@@ mann . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was finally active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has the opportunity to demonstrate his skills . &quot;
&quot; tor@@ op@@ ers Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie , after his conc@@ ussion , can return to the team again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una D√ºsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent cl@@ ash on the head .
&quot; however , contrary to the first app@@ reh@@ en@@ sions , he remained without a severe bl@@ ur . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy however : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Before all , Mang@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too firm to smell . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet food . &quot;
&quot; however , a man@@ go gives heart@@ y dishes a special note . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some blue leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot;
&quot; the US parcel service U@@ PS again provides up to 95@@ 0,000 foreign aid for the Christmas business in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are being sought .
&quot; already last year , U@@ PS had raised its workforce for the holiday season by 95@@ 000 ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming on @-@ line business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have used precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first F@@ √∂h@@ n@@ sturm , then marked cold @-@ front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ Side of the F@@ √∂h@@ n pass through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday , the fo@@ ehn partially blows with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ ehn @-@ valleys . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind @-@ bends and a temperature drop . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest flow . &quot;
on the north side of the Alps on the night to the Wednesday of the fo@@ ehn through the valleys .
&quot; as a result , the blow blows up to Thursday morning in the cavity valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i @-@ country partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; there are even or@@ bits of over 120 km / h , even on the mountains . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my blow for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the hill@@ side . &quot;
&quot; here , rain sets the rain that lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after the last few days already large rainf@@ all has fallen . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air runs out , as a result , a cold front with powerful , partly swe@@ ating rain from West to East crosses Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front the wind blow strongly to stor@@ m@@ ically , and the temperatures go well . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously un@@ named square in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft of Protestant Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , parish priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; with the place I will see in a symbolic way , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a comm@@ ited sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions should have strengthened him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the Ab@@ las Trading .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main pieces that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means in@@ significant with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapting the respective themes , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles that focus on topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publisher with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost discussing on the basis of painting with the respective scrip@@ tures .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current contexts into today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts paintings .
&quot; embedded between the original scrip@@ torium of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who form@@ ulates his personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry box has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant sovereign Order . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the reed , &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up that , in order to be able to bring me back to the Lord again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to make art more important in the fast @-@ moving time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have another desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to immer@@ se themselves in the images , let them appear , discover and sense the force they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; arose a picture of the Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M√∂@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s images speak for M√∂@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition , which is opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth@@ mo@@ wers for a circuit model@@ ed : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured land@@ ings , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill deport@@ ed , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first municipal council Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the child and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year &apos;s still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further remembrance &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must interest everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. √ñ@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; it will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
&quot; the decisive course , however , must put the policy . &quot;
the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some Federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals set out a clear sign when they will carry the &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that all should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ manager Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on to everyone , nobody can take away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ heim , Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the European Championship against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Nier@@ sbach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; . &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their locations have started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Board of Management loses an eye in accident
&quot; the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in July . &quot;
&quot; at the accident on the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried on the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood @-@ bloo@@ ded , impot@@ ent , then came out of the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , however , can follow his work . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully labour @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except ...

&quot; in Singapore on the weekend , he also comes as little as a reserv@@ ator for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have been torn apart . &quot;
the national player is also missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot resort to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his master elf at the re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of Stamm@@ tisch Roman B√ºr@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open to the future in all European League games in the future . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ci@@ ble statement of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , holds Julian W@@ eig@@ l &apos;s mid @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to get the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot;
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the fair IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
&quot; the automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his fellow colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication . &quot;
&quot; for testing new technology , a test track is currently being produced on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to avoid &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the per@@ missible top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on high@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly explained . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the journey across all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be more than 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
well each Fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to current state of the title , the D√ºsseldorf wants only to beat in singles on the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision will be at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said the Bundestag J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf during the European course in D√ºsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; explained single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the sl@@ ackl@@ ist in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became a European champion . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; said the world @-@ ranking fifth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a duck
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins that look human @-@ like due to video projections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he was hiding men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show above his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; For me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal &apos;s Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; it concerns tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completing an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograp@@ hed total artwork , for which much effort was carried out : to dev@@ ote the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
14 tons of material have ar@@ ra@@ yed the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ matic fashion beh@@ s of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he attracted ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them then of course .
for his first own fashion show he can &apos;t pay the models .
&quot; they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to do meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large quantity for customers , which they made for example for blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze fashion , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which leans on past stit@@ ches is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t use niche in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they are already half of all orders . &quot;
Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
private specialty stores and also wholesale distribution are almost no longer available .
our products hardly ever reach customers in this way .
&quot; today , the bulk goods are manufactured in the Asian region much cheaper and sold almost exclusively over chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , up to now , to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery mil@@ der in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been introducing a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger branch of the West@@ s√§chs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ marked the historical snow tip . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine le@@ aks little ch@@ icks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ √üe took inspiration from it : &quot; before , I could not do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the tip of the snow for her jewellery .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and who would like to have a commemor@@ ative piece . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie but a kind of continuation playing 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; but the director is already firmly fixed : Rob Marshall , last time with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI insi@@ sts on opening the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open itself wider to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to absorb private capital , and over@@ haul the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legally @-@ state business environment and is more open to the market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; within the framework of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investments will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilitates the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double down the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors , and to allow consumers to significantly increase the dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ World@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper from the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force in pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ word@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ or fish are so heavily bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury today that , on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be ru@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to Food@@ watch aims to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ World@@ watch called this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already hold the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cury is a heavy metal poison@@ ous for humans , which is largely accum@@ ulating over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns , that &quot; already small amounts can cause particular damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury enters the environment primarily through coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet with the Gre@@ ens Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mer@@ cury per year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish@@ ings approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
