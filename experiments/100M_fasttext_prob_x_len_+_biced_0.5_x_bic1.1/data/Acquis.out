a ) The application for inclusion of new raw material cali@@ bers in the list is directed by the associations of the watch industry of the community or by the producers based in the community of raw materials to the Swiss clock chamber . the request is to add a technical description of the raw material cali@@ ber .
the Swiss clock of movement carries this or the new cali@@ ber immediately to the mentioned list .

&quot; in view of this report , the institutes are able to draw from a Swiss company and a company of the community a game of clo@@ cks or watch movements , which is sufficiently representative and basically no more than 50 clo@@ cks or movements . &quot;
&quot; after controlling these games in accordance with the standards of legal technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their results and create a common report for the Mi@@ xed Commission with their conclusions and with their possible suggestions . &quot;

&quot; this agreement applies to goods transports where the goods are transported to road vehicles , trucks or containers without a cargo over one or more borders , if the transport is carried out in road transport between the beginning and end of the TI@@ R transport . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) that goods transport is carried out ( i ) with road vehicles , trucks or containers , which have been approved previously in Section III Section a ) , or &quot;
&quot; II ) with other road vehicles , trucks or containers , unless specified conditions specified in Chapter III Section C ) ; &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the laws and other provisions of a contracting party , the cancellation of input or output charges in the cases mentioned in paragraph 1 does not apply , so the br@@ anding association has to undertake to make payment in the amount of input or output taxes due to possible default interest rates . &quot;

&quot; the contractual parties will , however , avoid delayed carriage if the detected defects are of minor importance and there is no risk of smu@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) road vehicles or containers that do not meet the conditions that are relevant to their approval , may only be used again for goods transport under customs regulations when their original condition is restored or the vehicle has been re @-@ approved . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) No special customs document is required for the temporary import of road vehicles , trucks or containers used for transport in the TI@@ R process . &quot;

&quot; road vehicles or load recei@@ pts , which carry out a TI@@ R transport , have to carry a right @-@ hand side panel with the inscription &quot; &quot; TI@@ R &quot; &quot; in front and rear . &quot;
these boards must be so appropriate that they are well visible ; they must be det@@ achable .
&quot; ( 1 ) For each road vehicle or container , a separate Car@@ net TI@@ R is to be completed . &quot;
&quot; a single carrier , however , can be produced for a lor@@ ry or for several containers that are loaded on a single road vehicle or a lor@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , in the commodity manifest of the net TI@@ R the contents of each vehicle belonging to a freight train must be listed separately . &quot;
&quot; at least , there must be at least as many separ@@ able assumption - and err@@ rid sections , as required for the transport in question . &quot;

&quot; in such a case , the customs authorities of the contracting party , whose territory the goods are subsequently transported , recognise the Car@@ net TI@@ R for the continuation of the TI@@ R transport , provided the customs caps and / or the em@@ blem are intact . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route on which the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R in the area of a contracting party does not use the net , because easier procedures for customs clearance are offered or the use of such a procedure is not required . &quot;

1 . the contractual parties do not consider minor devi@@ ations in the provision of obligations related to the deadline and the duration of the journey .
&quot; customs administr@@ ations of the departure and destination country do not accept the devi@@ ations of the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R controller there , if these devi@@ ations concern customs procedures that took place before or after the TI@@ R transport and where the owner of the Car@@ net was not involved . &quot;
&quot; a satisfactory proof has been provided by the customs authorities that the goods listed in the commodity Manifest@@ o have been lost or lost by accident or force or that they are missing due to their nature due to natural sw@@ ings , so liberation from the üb@@ ben@@ wi@@ ese is granted to up@@ lifting customs duties and taxes . &quot;

&quot; B ) To ensure optimal cost effectiveness , for example , the following procedures are applied : I ) Sp@@ ati@@ al F@@ unding as a means for determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the verification procedures on the phases of the fuel @-@ cycle that could affect the production , processing , use and storage of nuclear material from which no further nuclear weapons and other core embr@@ itt@@ ings could be produced , and the greatest possible limitation of the verification procedures in other core material provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) To effectively implement the hed@@ ging measures pursuant to this Convention , the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention authori@@ zes information on core material that is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the systems that are responsible for conducting the hed@@ ging measures relating to this material of concern . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its duties under this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information about facilities is limited to the minimum required for the use of safety measures relating to the core material , which is subject to the hed@@ ging measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) At the request of the community , the organization is prepared to examine the investment data that the community considers particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally transferred to the organization , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization takes the consent of the Community and states to the appointment of inspec@@ tors for the States .
&quot; II ) En@@ sur@@ ing the Community either against a proposed appointment or at any time against a nom@@ ination , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; ( III ) If , due to the repeated refusal of the Community , to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization which is imp@@ eded by this Convention , the Council shall discuss the refusal , after him , the Director General of the Organisation - in the following as &quot; the General Director &quot; - in order to meet with the aim of meeting suitable measures . &quot;
B ) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually carry out the duties imposed upon them in accordance with their agreement .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up so that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) ensuring the protection of industrial secrets and others from the inspec@@ tors of the organization for knowledge @-@ related confidential information .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and balances , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , the duties under this Convention authori@@ ze the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the hed@@ ging measures in accordance with this agreement will end with regard to core material , if the community and the organization realize that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ re@@ usable for a nuclear activity that is under the viewpoint of the hed@@ ging measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the Community reports the transfer of nuclear material from the states that are subject to the hed@@ ging measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated in relation to core material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organization conduc@@ ts documents from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re @-@ use of the securing measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; should core material , which is subject to securing measures pursuant to this agreement , should be used in non @-@ nuclear activities such as the production of alloys or ceramics , the association with the organisation agrees with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in accordance with this agreement regarding this material . &quot;
II ) that the candle material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives during the duration of the non @-@ application of the hed@@ ging measures .
B ) The organization and community make provision for the protection measures envis@@ aged in this Convention only for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under which circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be applied once again as soon as the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is kept on the current account of the total quantity and composition of this material in the respective state or the states concerned , and on each passing of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it only covers matters such as temporary and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a sec@@ rec@@ y of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow out of their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , the States or persons subject to their jurisdiction , however extraordinary costs arise as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se such costs , provided that it has agreed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be applied to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nationals of the States . &quot;
any claim to which the community or state is asser@@ ted against the organization or the organization against the community or state because of damage from a nuclear incident - except for damages from a nuclear incident - is governed in accordance with international law .
&quot; after checking the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council ad@@ mits that the organization is not able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures after this Convention , shall refund the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the stat@@ ute and , if necessary , also take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied securing measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties involved is concerned - any opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state consul@@ ts take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; quar@@ rels which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , with the exception of disputes , are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another by the organization , the community and the states , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also design@@ ates two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth to lead the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization are not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the Community or the Organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is to be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Agreement does not apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and members of the community will be notified in force , i ) if the respective state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention . &quot;
II ) if the community of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties on a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately informs all Member States of the organisation of any change in this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day that the organization of the Community and States receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
&quot; B ) This agreement remains in force for so long , as the states are contracting party of the contract . &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of part I about securing measures .
&quot; the objective of the safety measures set out in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such bran@@ ching by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; for the enrich@@ ment of the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material not proven for a specified period is indicated in the indication of the accuracy limits for the given me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their checks , the organization is making full use of the community &apos;s security system after Article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance areas .
&quot; in the application of their security measures , the community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , see how they are more determined and practical in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , processed , lost , lost or otherwise from the continu@@ ance of distant core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ating measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) methods to evaluate invent@@ ories not measured invent@@ ories and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the hed@@ ging measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
&quot; ( B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) , divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , leaves the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is imported into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The provisions provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to the protection measures under this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community about the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community real@@ istically determine that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the hed@@ ging measures according to this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Core material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is rec@@ laimed , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the core material that would otherwise be subject to hed@@ ging measures pursuant to this Convention , provided that the entire amount of core material released in the States is no longer at no point in time due to this article in the states . &quot;
a ) A total of one kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of the enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of 10 metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if the core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ use of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary to determine the extent that is required for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in detail as the procedures laid down in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be expanded or altered without changing this agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake any efforts to allow these agreements to come into effect within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organization provides a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the hed@@ ging measures of this agreement in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme agreed at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by common resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the funds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC presented a table showing how to use the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization is set up a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special Inter@@ action Account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States are guided and used in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is listed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction bank and to be deposited in the organization of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) Payment takes place in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 . January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator in consideration of the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget@@ ary plans .
C ) Every Member State may be able to make payments in front of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional drawing to the cash or the Schul@@ tze , in order to cover the issues for the transaction loans and compensate for the special transaction bank in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its additional credit capacity to loan terms without dis@@ appro@@ ving ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly re@@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices , which are to be taken into account for the objective of such agreement under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction budget must not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions which are generally valid for the development loan granted by the organization ; therefore , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years respectively . &quot;
&quot; transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to the payment of this clock must be directly connected to the organization that it retains .
&quot; each transaction loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated . &quot;
&quot; revenues from each transaction loan can be used for issues in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are established or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee , could be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments from transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state shall be rejected as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC on the projects and programs approved by the directors to the complete awar@@ ding of all the transaction loans by the directors in preparation and on the projects approved by the directors .
&quot; during the period of payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator will quarterly inform the E@@ EC about the development of the transaction loans and the expenses incurred . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the manager transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction bank with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this bank account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the transaction loan , the E@@ EC car@@ et@@ aker will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and exec@@ utes suitable records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are attributable to payments received from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the funds from the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction budget , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date which the E@@ EC and the organization may agree on , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the entire capital amount of all the loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States will note the conclusion of the proceedings in question to the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat holds these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the Reg@@ ular approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
&quot; this agreement will be effective and will come into effect on the first day of the month , following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ cripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally authentic . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement in the form of a letter changed to the amend@@ ment of the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T issued the following CH@@ AN@@ GE : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Nu@@ clear Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , the construction and operation of a Joint Venture under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as J@@ ET , &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years , and is well acquainted with the region concerned . &quot;
&quot; because up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is still extensive work carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum up their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which have acquired a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enable any contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by bringing together their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes in App@@ endi@@ x I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective collaboration , the Swiss programme will take over long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it will be expanded or changed according to review by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , this will take place in place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
&quot; the association , intended in paragraph 1 , is realised through : - appropriate participation of any of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of staff among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; within the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom is committed to ensuring that Switzerland particip@@ ates in the agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated institutions , called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland coinci@@ des with the time of entry into force of the present agreement to the Common Enterprise J@@ ET , whose constitution accepts them . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become parties to any contract whose objective is to be concluded within the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are commissioned to carry out the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the association agreement must include the implementation of a steering committee , the representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ations in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG &quot; . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to the ongoing or planned programmes and activities within the Eur@@ atom Programme , takes this task as to all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated institutions and direc@@ ts its T * activity in the interest of the two contracting parties to the common objective set out in the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme as well as the common objective set out in Article 1 of the present agreement , while the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into account . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking to do so . &quot;
the groups of advis@@ ors who submit the VG research proposals for the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme take this task as to all research and development work carried out in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the participating laboratories as part of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the Board of Directors , which is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program are optimally util@@ ised in terms of all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees set up within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; coordin@@ ating committees which have appropriate proposals for the use of resources , personnel and knowledge and skills that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme take part in the respective field of research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F belong to the core and energy research responsible for each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in preparing the future programs and determining its overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at community level within the scope of the merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Direc@@ torate of Directors , the Advisory Groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement from the VG to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of human resource exchange .
&quot; the representatives of the two parties cooperate in the works of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Swiss financial contribution on the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount con@@ ten@@ tious to the Eur@@ atom &apos;s share of the Eur@@ atom and Switzerland &apos;s gross domestic product as the whole GDP of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the common enterprise as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland re@@ jects the Joint Venture of J@@ ET which is determined according to the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Joint Venture . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides to finance the work in the context of the association agreement and the agreement on staff exchange , is calculated on the same basis which is usually used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the relevant tre@@ aties . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the Commission informs the Federal Council that the amount to cover expenses in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the coming year is fores@@ een . &quot;
the Federal Council will pay the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 in front of the 15 .

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial advisory board
the BI@@ S could close Stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a suitable application .
&quot; the agreement could be concluded by the total amount of the contributions paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions have already been mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be prepared . &quot;
&quot; in each stand @-@ by loan , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ing extensions without the fact that a total of five years would be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans , as well as in the extension of the extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first draw would not be made prior to the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking account of the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those applied by the BI@@ S at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum with the corresponding margin raised by a corresponding margin . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the Council of the European Communities .
the BI@@ S could close Stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a suitable application .
I would be grateful if you would like to tell me the Council of the European Communities .

&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and on the wish expressed by the committee for trade negotiations at its meeting of 11 . and 12 April 1979 , the wish to achieve a uniform version of an agreement on the implementation of Article VII of the General In@@ come and Trade Agreement , &quot;
considering that Article 27 of the Convention has not yet entered into force - I
1 . agree to apply the determination of the article 1 paragraph 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
2 . acknowledge that the postpon@@ ement of the application of this Convention estimated for developing countries will be insufficient for five years in accordance with Article 21 ( 1 ) in practice for some developing countries .
&quot; in such cases , a developing country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before exp@@ ir@@ ation of the deadline stated in Article 21 ( 1 ) , with the agreement that the Parties shall examine such an application in cases where the country of development can provide good reasons ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . recognise that developing countries , who presently carry out the customs valuation on the basis of official minimum values , may want to make a reservation if necessary , in order to maintain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions that the contractual parties agree to ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . acknowledge that developing countries , which are of the opinion that the revers@@ al of the order of application to the application of the complain@@ ant according to Article 4 could cause actual difficulties , the wish may have the following reservation to Article 4 : &quot;
the government of : ... reserves the right to prescri@@ be that the relevant provision of Article 4 shall only apply if the customs authorities grant the application for the application of article 5 and 6 in reverse order .
&quot; if developing countries make such a reservation , the parties agree to this reservation according to Article 23 of their agreement ; &quot;
5 . recognise that developing countries can have the wish to make the following reservation in Article 5 paragraph 2 :
&quot; the government of ... reserves the right to stipul@@ ate that Article 5 paragraph 2 of the Convention is applied in accordance with the relevant note , even if the complain@@ ant has not provided an appropriate application . &quot;
&quot; if developing countries make such a reservation , the parties agree to this reservation according to Article 23 of their agreement ; &quot;
&quot; 6 . acknowledge that some developing countries have expressed concern that in the implementation of Article 1 of the Convention , problems may occur , insofar as it relates to individual or single @-@ group imports into their countries . &quot;
the parties agree that in case of occurrence of such problems in practice in developing countries that apply the Convention on the request of these countries to find suitable solutions ;
&quot; 7 . agree that Article 17 recognizes that customs administr@@ ations must perform tests in the application of the Convention , in order to convince themselves of the correctness or accuracy of information , declarations or documents issued for customs valuation . &quot;
&quot; they also agree that the article will detect that tests can be carried out , for example , to verify whether the values specified or submitted are complete and correct in combination with a customs value determination . &quot;
&quot; they acknowledge that contractual parties have the right to count on the full participation of the leaders in these investigations , subject to their national legislation and procedures ; &quot;
&quot; 8 . agree that the actual paid or paid price includes all payments , which are actually paid or paid to a third party for the purchase of the goods sold by the buyer to the seller or the buyer to a third party for the creation of a vendor &apos;s obligation . &quot;
&quot; it is the signing of the Convention for the implementation of Article VII of the General In@@ come and Trade Agreement , as well as other governments that acc@@ ede to this Convention by Article 22 , to be accepted by signing or in another form . &quot;
&quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trading with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , &quot;
&quot; I respect the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties will be agreed as follows : &quot;
&quot; - Fres@@ h or cooled H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be determined by the community to the following annual amount : 20,000 tonnes expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is committed to ensuring that the actual annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed according to traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community is entitled to use the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access of Argentina &apos;s regulated access to the Community market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina are exceeding the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ of set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; at the entry of new member states , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount of the Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State under number 2 . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are stipul@@ ated in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which is taken into account under the number 5 mentioned ho@@ axes of exhaus@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is determined by the tag of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of battle body weight . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ b@@ meat in the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the community meets provisions so that the sale of frozen meat to frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other subsi@@ dy measures for the export of sheep and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be made in accordance with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms shall be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , corresponds to Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of the article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ come and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences for the products referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in its turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issuing of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of an export licence , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods in question .

&quot; agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &quot;
&quot; I respect@@ fully respect the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are exist@@ ential in the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - Fres@@ h or cooled H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement New Zealand will ensure the access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement , for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
new Zealand receives assurance that the normal sales of its sponge - and lamb &apos;s meat are not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the determined amount does not exceed the determined amount . &quot;
the quantities specified above are executed in the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand is not supposed to be prevented with this agreement to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position in the Community market .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community demands protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand that are arising out of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of imports collected from this agreement to a ho@@ of set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities stipul@@ ated in Cl@@ ause 2 to the extent of New Zealand trading with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are stipul@@ ated in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ump of the exhaus@@ tion mentioned in clause 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
the total quantity mentioned in clause 2 is set with the tag of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 2@@ 45 500 tonnes of slaughter body weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ b@@ meat in the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets provisions so that the sale of frozen meat to frozen meat is not under@@ mining due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of she@@ ep@@ skin in the community without risk of market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other subsi@@ dy measures for the export of sheep and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be made in accordance with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities . &quot;
&quot; in its turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issuing of import licenses for the aforementioned products , originating in New Zealand , is made dependent on the submission of an export licence , which is issued by the designated area designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods in question .
&quot; in the case of implementing provisions , it is also specified that the competent authority of the competent authority of the responsible community in regular intervals informs the quantities for which export licenses have been given ; these details may , if necessary , en@@ code to destination country . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works flaw@@ lessly .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets including the terms stated in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products made of sponge , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will be carried out under the agreements not mentioned in the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions that arise in the implementation of the agreement , which shall be presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall be without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual amount stipul@@ ated in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement is set up to 1 January of the following year , in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the other hand , on the one hand and for the main territory of New Zealand on the one hand . &quot;
&quot; this agreement entered into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a deadline of one year . in any case , the provisions of this Agreement will be reviewed before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary . &quot;

&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective share . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each container is a black and white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each specific@@ ity can be one of two species that are distinguished by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge is achieved .
&quot; with others labeled as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or using other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on property carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are washed up in their own serum or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may change if international standard preparations are available . i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more individuals imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 percent salt solution . &quot;
&quot; an &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ Rh@@ o serum or a corresponding comparison of C@@ c@@ Dec@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells containing the Do @-@ An@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are determined to use object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more individuals imm@@ uni@@ zed by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floods of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C an@@ tigen if the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution .
the Tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus c@@ c@@ d@@ ote hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more individuals imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a Tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E. serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination period in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than with the ant@@ ice antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparison plant , separated with in@@ und@@ ations of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 per cent up@@ stream of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
anti @-@ B ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B @-@ an@@ tigen ; that is the blood group B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain any B @-@ an@@ tigen ; this means those of blood groups 0 and A .
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison plant , with a flood of blood cells belonging to group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ filtration of B @-@ blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology has to contain ag@@ glut@@ ination antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ ination antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals that have been immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
&quot; it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s instructions , so it ag@@ glut@@ ates no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , no matter what blood type they belong . &quot;

an anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum must cause a strong ag@@ glut@@ ination of the red blood cells in the supplied form or in the di@@ lution shown on the label if the ti@@ tr@@ ation is performed with a ti@@ ter of D @-@ positive blood cells following the &quot; Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ Re@@ placement &quot; method .
in the same di@@ lution it is necessary to ag@@ glut@@ inate sensi@@ ti@@ zed K @-@ positive human red blood cells with selected anti @-@ antibodies and the sensitive F@@ ya @-@ positive red blood cells with selected anti @-@ antibodies .
&quot; in the same or another di@@ lution shown on the label , human red blood cells must also ag@@ glut@@ inate , which are sensi@@ ti@@ zed in the presence of fresh human serum with weak comple@@ ment@@ dal in@@ complete anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot;
&quot; for clinical use , the loading with all types of the above @-@ mentioned in@@ complete antibodies should be proven with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum . &quot;
anti @-@ A re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the seed or other parts of a suitable plant and possibly subsequent cleansing .
&quot; the Anti @-@ A Re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ anti@@ gens , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A re@@ agent is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparison plant , separated against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the re@@ agent should amount to less than 64 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5 to 10 per cent up@@ stream of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group agent ( ii ) anti @-@ B blood group re@@ agent ( vegetable ) &quot;
anti @-@ B re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the corresponding part of a suitable plant and if necessary subsequent cleansing .
&quot; the anti @-@ B re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells containing ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen B , that is the blood group B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen B , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ filtration of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time that is required if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;

&quot; in the provision that the community has decided within the action programme to strengthen the internal market , as of January 1 , 1988 , a uniform management paper will be introduced in the internal Community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that it is appropriate to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a uniform management document , &quot;
&quot; in the provision that this agreement should not be interpreted as a consequence , that it bin@@ ds the parties to its obligations arising from other international conventions - &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; this includes , in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a single paper ) , which is to be used for all export and import processes as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) in the goods traffic between the contracting parties . &quot;
&quot; the contractual obligations associated with the exchange of goods between the contractual parties are gro@@ unded by a single agent , for which preliminary prints are to be used according to the samples in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the single paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping and import . &quot;
&quot; - to be expressly required to carry out the legislation in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed for any use of the safety document ; &quot;
&quot; - to be required by the parties involved , so that they can come to a request in the enjoyment of a share or a certain facil@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the participants . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ le procedures may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned shall not be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the Custom@@ s Office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , an application must subsequently be filed with the approval of the competent authorities in order to make a peri@@ odic collection reservation within the deadline established by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trading papers instead of the single @-@ paper api@@ xel . &quot;

&quot; ( 1 ) The registration must be issued in one of the official languages of the contractual parties authorised by the competent authorities of the country , in which the form@@ alities for export or shipping are authorised . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or the country of transit may require a translation of the application to the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In dero@@ gation from paragraph 1 , registration must always be issued in one of the official languages of the import country , if it occurs in this country by the use of other copies of the import or departure country prior to registration . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative can only use the registration copies required for each individual procedure of a service agreement between the contractual parties , who may be accompanied by the required samples to clarify the form@@ alities in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collecting shipments , the relevant authorities can see , however , that the delivery and shipping methods are transferred to one and the same pres@@ sured by means of the copies provided for these form@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the relevant authorities shall , as far as possible , agree that the information contained in the copies of the application in the individual process stages must be consistent . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth transit between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries ask each other for information or - if they are interested in a different contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be refused or rejected in whole or in part , if the sought @-@ after country of view is that the administrative assistance would interfere with its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate a business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;

( 3 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee resol@@ ves changes to the annex@@ es to this Convention as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 ( 3 ) .
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party accepted a resolution under the provis@@ o of the constitutional requirements under the provis@@ o , the decision , provided there is no date , entered into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the repe@@ al of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party meets appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced performance of this Convention , with the need to take into account the need to reduce the burden of goods traffic as much as possible and to provide satisfactory solutions at the application of the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , on the one hand and for the territories of EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;

&quot; the contractual partner DI@@ ES@@ ES accor@@ ds , which has been elabor@@ ated under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the Council for co @-@ operation in the field of customs , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ DER , to facilitate the acquisition , comparison and evaluation of statistical data , especially those of international trade , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ DER to reduce the costs resulting from the fact that goods in international commerce have to be re @-@ labeled , re @-@ submitted and re @-@ enco@@ ded in the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the standardis@@ ation of the trade documents and the transmission of data , &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing that the development of technology and the structures of international trade necess@@ itated significant changes to the Brussels agreement on 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff scheme for the entry of the goods to customs tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; moreover , the degree of differentiation , demanded by governments and the economy for customs tari@@ ff and statistical purposes , goes far beyond that which is contained in the plant to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; weighing that the harmon@@ ized system should be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of different types of transport , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that the harmon@@ ized system is determined as far as possible into the systems used in the trade for the identification and encoding of goods , &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing that the harmon@@ ised system should contribute to a close inter@@ relation between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other , IN DER , that a close relationship between the Harmon@@ ised System and the International War@@ ehouse for the Foreign Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations should be preserved , &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing that it is desirable to meet the requirements specified above by a combined customs tari@@ ff and statistics arrangement , which is suitable for use by the international trade concerned ; &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ised system to the development of technology and the structures of international trade , &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for the cooperation in the field of customs services , provided for the harmon@@ ised system in this field , &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing that - although the aforementioned agreement on the customs tari@@ ff scheme has proven to be an effective tool to achieve some of these goals , the conclusion of a new international convention is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot;
&quot; a ) &quot; harmon@@ ized system for the designation and coding of goods , &quot; in the following &quot; harmon@@ ised system , &quot; consisting of the positions and sub @-@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from the notes to the sections . chapters and sub @-@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ised system ; &quot;

&quot; the parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for co @-@ operation in the field of customs , &quot;
&quot; it is desirable that the international agreement concluded on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods commen@@ ced on January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing that without a change in Article 13 of the aforementioned Convention , the time of entry into force of this Convention would continue to remain uns@@ af@@ e - &quot;
