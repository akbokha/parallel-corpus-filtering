&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; • Whi@@ r@@ ling thoughts and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not available ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness in which the patients alternating with man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternate with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients responding to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or fusion tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are just like Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemicals that allow the nerve cells to communicate with each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing her recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the recovery of symptoms , was examined in three trials over to a year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which led to increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that led to increased rest@@ lessness caused by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment was examined . &quot;
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and resor@@ ption to absorption ( absor@@ bs ) .
&quot; in the two trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly stronger reductions in symptoms than those receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and , in addition to an existing treatment , was administered . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also significantly reduced the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders , ac@@ ath@@ isie ( lack of movement ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , secre@@ tion ( increased sali@@ vation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weighed the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , were out@@ weighed against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is related to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to combined entities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution must be taken when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ iz@@ ers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( al@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and the concerns produced in the reproductive studies of the animal , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - a controlled long @-@ term study lasting more than 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared with Parkinson &apos;s , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events related to an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death succession . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ G 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity with the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ C receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for more than 2 weeks to healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) with 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents with a response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study lasting 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium and hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed itself superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ stimulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ ung is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ iz@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
there was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; one single dose study in subjects with varied liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans based on conventional safety , toxic@@ ity , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no significance for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a consequence of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole do not exceed 6 % of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the average steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ G 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed itself superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed itself superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively take tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders have been reported in some cases after onset or change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscular rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to combined entities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole

&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients already receiving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should continue with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ G 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study lasting 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 Out of this a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a consequence of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the average steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and begin with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status given to the medicines used for conservation or ac@@ ut @-@ therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melted tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure decrease ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to combined entities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; however , the intensity of the se@@ gregation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) were used intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly for a single dose and the same at the same time lau@@ re@@ ate ( 2 mg dose ) was intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; 105 . the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; metabolism can result in joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 into higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ gregation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ amine Reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement of bas@@ eline scores on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms statisti@@ cally significantly . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents &apos; response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( or@@ ally ) and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for more than 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se decreased by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study , more than 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared the prevention of bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated exposure to systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were intra@@ muscular in 15 or 5 times over the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application showed no safety @-@ relevant concerns following mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; thus , they have limited or no significance for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a consequence of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in general or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 treated patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the drug &apos;s efficacy indicators , such as time to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it must also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es in their blood before starting treatment .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects in contrast to other medicines containing Pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phy number &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment should be interrupted until improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on the safety and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
in the patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients following the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients , who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
male patients should be advised before treatment via sperm conservation as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect transport and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of abrasion . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed in Table 1 are the side effects associated with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , increased cre@@ atine in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of the muscles , back pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a timi@@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing its dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel with end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ sen@@ d@@ mes@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umen receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ blin@@ ded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was administered in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma . &quot;
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ meditation to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ meditation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metasta@@ sis and 19 % due to metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival , progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
&quot; the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; 10 Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the IV dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase way . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly distribution and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) following the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration compared to a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is reported primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative kidney ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as in other potentially toxic substances it should be handled with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast cancer when other therapies have been tried , but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used : if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pac@@ lit@@ axel or one of the other parts of Abra@@ x@@ ane , if you are breast@@ feeding , if your white blood cells are reduced ( initial values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about this ) &quot;
&quot; special caution when using Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : if you have a impaired kidney function , if you suffer from num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness , if you suffer from severe liver problems • If you have heart problems &quot;
&quot; if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines , please inform the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently used it , even if it is not prescription drugs , as these might cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; in addition , they should be advised before the treatment of sperm conservation , because the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of lasting in@@ fertility . &quot;
air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the use of machines Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect transport and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; if you receive other medicines as part of your treatment , you should consult your doctor regarding driving or serving machines . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; if it is not used immediately , it can be stored in the bottle up to 8 hours in the fridge ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) if it is stored in the cart@@ on to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; each penetration bottle contains 100 mg Pac@@ lit@@ axel . • After the re@@ constitution , each ml of the Sus@@ pension contains 5 mg Pac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other component is alb@@ um@@ ulation of humans ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for the preparation and application of pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as in other potentially toxic substances should be handled with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane leak@@ age bottle .
&quot; then slowly and carefully t@@ oss the pier@@ cing bottle for at least 2 minutes and / or in@@ vert , until a complete reset of the powder is carried out . &quot;
&quot; the exact total dose of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and the corresponding quantity of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PVC in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot;
&quot; before applying a visual inspection , par@@ enter@@ al medicines should be checked for possible particles and disc@@ olo@@ ur@@ ation whenever the solution or the container allow this . &quot;
stability un@@ opened pier@@ cing bottles with Abra@@ x@@ ane are stable up to the date indicated on the packaging when the pier@@ cing bottle is stored in the cart@@ on to protect the contents from light .
&quot; after the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should immediately be filled into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot;
member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the placing of the market before the market launch the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing material . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , cold boxes for transport by patients . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood counts , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before the treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted that enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was treated as an injection in a vein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by an@@ a@@ emia , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either supplied to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as with those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ ra@@ ine @-@ like headaches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , it was demonstrated that the medicine showed a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with planned large operating procedures that require a large volume of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;

H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and disease may vary depending on age , gender and total illness ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease . &quot;
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed via or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher conservation doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher conservation doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
starting dose : 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total illness ; therefore , the doctor is required to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permissible dose which is required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained once a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have increased compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa treatment is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery . &quot;
&quot; as early as possible , iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the se@@ amed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and the day of intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop under the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following prec@@ urs@@ ors , esc@@ ort or coron@@ ary diseases ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident . &quot;
&quot; ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely , PR@@ CA was reported on the occurrence of an@@ tigen @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be investigated and the common causes for failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxy@@ to@@ xi@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value , considering an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ loc@@ te &quot; Index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te figures are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row can be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , an increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ id @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit derived from epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for control of an@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy ( patients who may need to trans@@ act trans@@ fusion ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded by excess of 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the goal of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the patient that should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can be associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro investigations on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; through th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , brain inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood supply can cause th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
the biotechn@@ ologically generated epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and is identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine an@@ em@@ ic patients with regard to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a significantly higher mortality rate than in the controls due to various more frequent malign@@ ancies . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism occurring in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients receiving chemotherapy with the goal of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ provisions after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved after IV injection . &quot;
there is no cum@@ ulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 in animal experimental studies with approximately the 20@@ x of the weekly recommended weekly dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ec@@ tal body weight , a delay in the oscill@@ ation and a rise in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;

&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated prior to the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; very rarely , ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kl@@ ed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value can cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or rising cali@@ bre reflections , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically manifest coron@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age signs with inadequate heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bic mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully vis @-@ à @-@ vis the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if you require a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood @-@ color@@ ant ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently used / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are using C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( mean to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will possibly arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; as soon as you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg will be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the intervention and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have suffered a low trau@@ matic frac@@ ture as in falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for the assessment of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a frac@@ ture frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials involving 35@@ 7 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme , the bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % relative to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis supplements ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis supplements ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for Ac@@ ro@@ sta &apos;s placing in the European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing aid &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ tures , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the initial ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing &lt; 35 ml / min it is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this group of patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on the safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with a sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate pre@@ ven@@ tional dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental implants , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ ro@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with placebo compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials compared to 21 % . &quot;
&quot; all patients received supple@@ mental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a recently issued hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw region was studi@@ ously , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw region ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients have signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
&quot; in 7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients , oste@@ o@@ arthritis occurred in the jaw area of one with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ rical verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the incidence of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduction in verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; the effects on ac@@ la@@ sta hip frac@@ tures showed a lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ c acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ment of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the th@@ igh @-@ neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the tank ridge were taken . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture . &quot;
&quot; bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly decreased by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was maintained at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value until 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was maintained at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value until 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months , and was maintained at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value until 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased compared to placebo treatment compared to placebo treatment at all times .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo treatment by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once @-@ yearly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
the effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once daily for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control compared to bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at was observed after 6 months . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 using Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life t ½ to 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al @-@ life t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages of distribution ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total @-@ body clear@@ ance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearing of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , drug @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function problem down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
&quot; since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) contains only limited data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
&quot; according to studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ x of the recommended humane @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with IV application , the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was determined in rats by doses ranging from 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the age of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Metap@@ hysi@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ resor@@ ption of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity was observed in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum @-@ calcium level . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , am@@ ended on 29 September 2006 , in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , the pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system described in force is and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
Ris@@ co @-@ Management @-@ Plan The owner of the license for the placing of the market obli@@ ges the studies and additional activities for the pharmaceutical industry to carry out the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an over@@ worked R@@ MP should be filed • If new information is known , which could affect the current security , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been achieved . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently used / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicine from which it is known to be harmful to the kidneys .
&quot; when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drink , be sure to take enough fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta is active for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after the in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you missed Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta In case you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please notice your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but after the subsequent in@@ fusion , however , less frequent . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache appear within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; it is currently unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , ti@@ redness , ting@@ ling sensation , diar@@ rhe@@ a , diar@@ rhe@@ a , loss of appetite , diar@@ rhe@@ a , stomach upset , abdominal pain , pain in the stomach , pain , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported primarily in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate due to other diseases .
&quot; an allergic reaction , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture suggest that Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion should be carried out two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients have to be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ comp@@ lia is used as a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond , one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he reported the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were noted during the studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable with simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ xi@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have any identi@@ fiable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other close relatives ) are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) before less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects associated with treatment in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who were treated for weight reduction and associated metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding placebo ( for un@@ desirable effects , ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very often &quot;
only slight symptoms were observed in a di@@ gesti@@ bility study in which a limited number of individuals were given one @-@ time charges of up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year for A@@ comp@@ lia was 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the bas@@ eline , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg of CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 weight reduction and further risk factors In the studies in patients with no diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average drop of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen by 6.@@ 9 % ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with a bas@@ eline of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvements to the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; 2 hours achieved , the steady @-@ state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28@@ ,@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;

patients with black skin color can be up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C have as patients of other ethnic populations .
n @-@ popularity Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Analysis ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical studies , but were observed in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were evaluated as potentially relevant for the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the start of con@@ vul@@ sions with process @-@ related stress seems to be linked to the handling of animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disturbances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ) is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by applying the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values showed a decrease of 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional placebo given a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ dies@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can not be used .
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ so problems , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be reviewed . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ ato@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market introduction , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ dus indi@@ ions , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but or@@ derly physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the interactions of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal during pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the sensor and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege was more than three times the upper limit of the normal range , albeit less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies was carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study lasting 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms oc@@ cured . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide was continued for two years to study the time to release the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; after two years of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin in spite of three months of optimization , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels , as well as in@@ significant , clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the overall plas@@ z@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while lower values were observed in met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial enhanced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease in groups receiving either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in about three times the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after the oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subject ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the average plasma elim@@ inations period of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced . &quot;
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ tho@@ don@@ ons led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and apply on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in a further study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zide were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both via an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study presented the goal with respect to its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving treatment of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women was seen . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial enhanced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as can produce no insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use the insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror indicating that the blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before trips that go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times . &quot;
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and his patients will always ask for other medications taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia may however develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sugar @-@ containing foods .
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have glucose pieces , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is intraven@@ ously given by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the division is active .
&quot; based on conventional safety therapeu@@ tics , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of fast acting insulin must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; before trips that go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times . &quot;

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous hem@@ or@@ o@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum reaches within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
&quot; the data is limited , but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults . &quot;

take the cap off . • disinf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Use always for each injection a new injection needle to avoid contamination . • Take the protective needle straight and firm on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • P@@ ull out the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Hold Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • knock a few times with your finger easily against the cartridge .
&quot; while air bubbles are present , they will accumulate up in the cartridge - While you continue to hold the injection needle upwards , turn the cartridge around one click in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • Dur@@ ing the injection needle continues to show up , press the pressure knob all in ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must be taken out of the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
&quot; • Place the cap again on the finished pen , so that the digit 0 is opposite the metering mark ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the press button is completely pressed . &quot;
&quot; if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed from the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves outside while you rotate the cap • The scale below the push button ( press dial scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; 107 • Record the highest number you can see on the press dial • add the two numbers to get the pres@@ et dose • If you have set a wrong dose , rotate the cap step for@@ wards or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you will feel a resistance , then take the cap off and set it again , that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite . &quot;
make sure to press only during the injection to push the button • Hold down the pressure knob all the way after injection until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
&quot; you may not set a dose that is higher than the number of remaining units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use them to adjust or select your dose . &quot;

&quot; if one of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor , your diabe@@ tic consultant or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
keep the cap of your fle@@ x@@ pen ready @-@ to @-@ use when it is not in use to protect it from light .
&quot; F H@@ ide the fle@@ x@@ pen with the injection needle upwards and pound gently against the cartridge for a few times , so that existing bubbles gather in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge . &quot;
&quot; the dose can be corrected both upwards and down@@ wards by turning the dose of the dose into the appropriate direction , until the correct dose is compared to the dose of the dose indicator . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of de@@ formation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atic no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger deposits of ur@@ anium , which can result in joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per month after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic are still using other medicines for preventing g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / d@@ l. during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) had a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ l. &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients in placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver function . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic an@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including a disease known from the medical history , and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) . &quot;
if the serum pole hed@@ geho@@ g is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks a dose increase can be taken into consideration at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 times a day .
&quot; until now , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in children and adolescents the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
&quot; since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or heart failure is not recommended for treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ essing medications , there may be an acute g@@ out attack during treatment , because the lowering of serum levels of serum may initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ h@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so common that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical trials , slight percep@@ tions of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the beginning of the ebu@@ ffer treatment and subsequent clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ 1 did not perform interactions with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O hin@@ dran@@ ce can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; subjects were associated with concur@@ rent application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen 250 mg twice daily with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the application of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the concur@@ rent other active ingredient is required .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 m@@ g. of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , slow@@ s down the intake of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be excluded from side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when paying a vehicle , serving machines or in exercising hazardous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ute in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ kler@@ ec@@ tomy and / or a yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) adverse events related to the medicine and which have been reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ not@@ e@@ th@@ esia , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , cou@@ ghing , short@@ ness of breath , skin dis@@ col@@ oration , rash in blood , increase of TS@@ H concentration in blood , decrease in the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ in@@ metabolism and is produced as part of the reaction chain Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ure@@ a . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ specific serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of serum resin @-@ acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 times daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / d@@ l. received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of recur@@ ren@@ al acid concentrations in patients , not@@ withstanding their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l. at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data collected in the phase 3 open extension study showed that the persist@@ ently lowering of serum levels in serum cases showed less than 3 % of the patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the amount of g@@ able knots , which resulted in 54 % of the total disappearance of the rheum@@ atic no@@ des by 24 months . &quot;
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and were also received in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum resin concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ scopy showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ute cur@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ Mark@@ ed F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose found in the urine was found as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose is found in the stool as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
&quot; 12 H@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ treated group , approximately the 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in the case of high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction in re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 4.3 @-@ fold and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not produce ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ specific serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the data collected in the phase 3 open extension study showed that the persist@@ ently lowering of serum levels in serum cases showed less than 3 % of the patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorisation has to ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application , is ready before the drug is put into circulation and is available for as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented at risk management systems for human medicine with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; an update of the R@@ MP is also necessary • if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization operations • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmaceutical company vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation will be prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is reached . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have or had a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • if you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration following a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder where too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood is found ) .
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be the case with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first week of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently used / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicine using one of the following substances since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your physician may consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart diseases )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on the transport ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery .
please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster packing , the individual week@@ days are printed , so you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are brow@@ sed ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data showing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose , which is required for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cer ( blo@@ ated stomach ) , asc@@ ended abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic u@@ pro@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it should not be used in case of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ha@@ ha@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ha@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( in part these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the physician will therefore draw attention to all the signs and symptoms that point to potential o@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to consult with symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ dom@@ inal pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn of the medicine ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at did not establish an increased risk , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therap@@ ist contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there is no data available that indicates whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a s@@ late surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning while taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing its failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but should continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials in common with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly harmful effects regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis was also reported . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , decreases of serum cal@@ ci@@ um to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / l ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ struction of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ids to vitamin D@@ 3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ quote D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum @-@ calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a deficiency can lead to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y and thus to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;
&quot; bone mineral density in spine or hip , which is 2.5 standard devi@@ ations below the average for a normal , young population , or despite bone density as this path@@ ological frac@@ ture . &quot;
patients received AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in lower strength ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( n = 350 ) or Fos@@ am@@ ax ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ) 70 mg once a week ( n = 3@@ 32 ) ; additional vitamin D supplements were prohibited .
&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeutic equi@@ valence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ center study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the middle intake of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the drop@@ let . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and the trou@@ gh continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate figure by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo ( 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically meaningful changes in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats show that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is divided into female tissues after IV administered of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ ec@@ es . &quot;
after IV dose of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 71 ml / min and systemic clearing exceeded 200 ml / min .
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not believed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) following the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before intake of a meal , the middle area was below the serum concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into consideration endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) . &quot;

adv@@ ant is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver to prevent transplan@@ ted organ rejection by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , comparing the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examines how adv@@ ant is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when other ( especially some herbal ) drugs be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with adv@@ ant , as the adv@@ ant dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or super@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; changes in formulation or regime should only be undertaken under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ ph should primarily be based on clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurements ( see below )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level of seb@@ um , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ ting under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the adv@@ ant dose can take several days before the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of drugs , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentr@@ ates for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further adap@@ tations can be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation : conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from two daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one time daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) has to be taken in relation to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ t following a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must commen@@ ce for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; in adult patients who are converted to adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; although there is no clinical experience with lawyers in lung , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , Pro@@ gra@@ f has an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ral transplan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adap@@ tations in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood pressure in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advised caution ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case involving the aid of whole blood @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level controls .
&quot; it is recommended to carry out common controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of seb@@ um in the blood exceeds 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the blood vessels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in the wake of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; changes in formulation or regime should only be undertaken under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be an anti@@ psych@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant towards other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data are available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f are available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients .
&quot; the use of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with adv@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) is due to possible interactions that may lead to a degradation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy known as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; as adv@@ ant hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose present , special caution is required in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , thus increasing or decreasing the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while at the same time adding substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain the same concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive actions are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a low number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o @-@ exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;

&quot; cases of anti @-@ virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including treatment with adv@@ ant . &quot;
it was reported via ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma protein , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucleus .
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thus preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ ar@@ ine genes . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cles ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; 175 patients were transplan@@ ted , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases following a color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation An interim analysis of a recently conducted multi@@ center trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ acy syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ aties et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came to 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis in comparison to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ t rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45@@ ,@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ aties et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in one study the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi@@ center trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ized procedure called tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; early detection methods of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to talks between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metabol@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via the bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients receiving Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to carry out common controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be an anti@@ psych@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant towards other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data are available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; 28 confirmed sho@@ cks were 3@@ 2,@@ 6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) . &quot;

&quot; lawyers are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; lawyers are similar to another in the European Union called &quot; &quot; Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate &quot; , &quot; but it is produced differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate @-@ severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under 6 years of age , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of ble@@ ed@@ ings in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood tests was rated &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of lawyers ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; lawyers may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit to transfer lawyers to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , a reasonable determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
&quot; 3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kil@@ ogram of body weight should be given within 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ al@@ ising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II , Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ low ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation period has no experience . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s found in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II spi@@ ke occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate revealed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory type ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed more severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patient to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , ur@@ itus , r@@ ashes and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co factor for the activated Factor IX and speeds up the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still considers the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP , based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited submitted the CH@@ MP Committee to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company re@@ trac@@ ts its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; , &quot; which has been modified so that no copies of itself can be produced and thus no infection can trigger in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to re@@ generate the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ structure , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ anti@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether it has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ p @-@ Use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; modified drug release &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be followed by the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 days treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in examining all ha@@ yst@@ ack symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients taking pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients with Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , ti@@ redness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ eck @-@ glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary retention ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of a ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age due to lack of data on the safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have gone .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , since long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment may be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks of ending such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ inet , erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group , and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or a strengthening of the headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treatment of the following patient groups is recommended : • Pati@@ ents under digital@@ is • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; however , as part of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences could be detected between the patients treated with placebo and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impairment of the transport ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental attention , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ illary star@@ re and - dile@@ mma , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the suspension of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ ul@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P sel@@ ector on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no effect on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks connected with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was determined . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 were present with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the mu@@ cos@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; in view of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ tal application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablet in healthy adults , it was found that four subjects dis@@ infected Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine following the exclusive use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure after the gift of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , the Pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance System is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a of the medicine pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or illnesses occur or are diagnosed with you under the application of Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or reduces the attention . &quot;

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml si@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inclusion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg am@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptom count ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two trials of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents between 12 and 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous illness process and may be terminated after the symptoms have died and re@@ appear again .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy term .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking er@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impairment of transport ti@@ ghtness or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently reported adverse events reported more often than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients of 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was headache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered .
&quot; this includes both the suspension of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ ul@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P sel@@ ector on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses , administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for more than 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks connected with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tear and redness of the eyes , and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown in the overall core of the questionnaire for quality of life in the Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine emission is a caus@@ al factor in all cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected that in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria this leads to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with placebo compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in vi@@ vo and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( fat , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) were not based on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
&quot; based on conventional safety , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; eri@@ us can be taken irrespective of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with as@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical tests and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher endurance ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metabol@@ ised , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day more than 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not find increased frequency of sleep@@ iness in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; with a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in clinical studies did not cause any impairment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not increase the impairment of alcohol @-@ induced deterioration in performance or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall core of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the induced by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metabol@@ ised . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ stimulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , C@@ MA@@ x and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to those recommended by adults with the recommended doses of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ cing bottles with child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene connector cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied .
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was determined . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no effect on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall core of the questionnaire for quality of life in the Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the placebo group Si@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly decrease the safety profile found in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ at for the neh@@ men@@ - formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no effect on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies carried out by A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ tabl@@ ette with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall assessment of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irritation tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk of local irritation in clinical applications .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metabol@@ ised , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most frequent side effects reported were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) , and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution . &quot;
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not find increased frequency of sleep@@ iness in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall core of the questionnaire for quality of life with Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio @-@ equi@@ valence study was necessary and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to those recommended by adults with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. formally notified the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company will withdraw its application for the introduction of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus emerges , which can easily spread from humans to humans , because humans do not yet have immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; once the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this common ancest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body detects as a foreign body ) has been puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base did not suff@@ ice to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination is not examined . &quot;
&quot; if the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral medicines have taken the patient previously , a@@ gen@@ ase should be prescribed and the probability of the virus to be addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg of p@@ inion and other anti@@ viral drugs twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ el depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ val@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in 20@@ 6 adults , formerly used as prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , this medicine was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alter@@ ation of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load of more than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but of the children previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a met with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who further received their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are degra@@ ded as well as a@@ gen@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ gen@@ ase have the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ a was not proven in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of a@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ el is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ el should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of p@@ inion cavi@@ ar ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ el capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily , together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ el capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ chi@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data on the safety and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ chi@@ ase in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and , moreover , represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ el capsules are to be used together with low doses of p@@ inion and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects potentially fatal .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function , including chronic active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous dose of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opathy including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , it can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of breath , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ el solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ a@@ dis@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases in which medicines were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. Higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in ble@@ ed@@ ings including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immuno@@ deficiency can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic margin should not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width , and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic margin A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for the higher plasma levels .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which may result in a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; in an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; when one patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , to check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; increased by 50@@ 8 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the fantas@@ tical component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ a are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is necessary . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs are to be used simultaneously , be careful as Del@@ a@@ virus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as an accurate predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ a , a reduction of the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ a in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous use of 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may result in interactions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as a@@ gen@@ ase since it can cause resor@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with as@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous dose of a@@ gen@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive enh@@ ancements of the plasma levels can be expected at the same time administration of A@@ gener@@ el . &quot;
&quot; as plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ el should not be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using A@@ gener@@ el with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the dose of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standard ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as a gift from A@@ gener@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s safety was investigated in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ chi@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ a or any other medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ a twice a day . &quot;
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) reported by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ dic fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated subjects , treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , was only observed in one case ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients were treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; rash was usually mild to moderate @-@ severe , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immuno@@ deficiency can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
&quot; patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ a twice a day with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable to those observed in general A@@ gener@@ a treatment ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ a together with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed for signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ Pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the consequence of formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , which received 700@@ mg of f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) participated in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always extract the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ ant trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ist resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ el in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study in which PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) were obtained with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ a , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ stop threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ ble@@ ached A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dose of p@@ inion was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; a@@ gen@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with children treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; increased by 50@@ 8 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , minimal concentration in the steady state ( c@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component varies throughout the dosing interval , depending on the total amount of medication in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ a ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; out of the solution , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ el solution and A@@ chi@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; this treatment scheme leads to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels similar to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day , with no simultaneous dosing of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals , corresponding to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.2 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and in vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests that included bacterial reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rabbit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ el capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ chi@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which may result in a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; increased by 50@@ 8 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as an accurate predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ a , a reduction of the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine

&quot; with simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standard ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one plus 1.0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .

A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s safety was investigated in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed for signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ist resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; a@@ gen@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with the child treated with PI . &quot;

&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and in vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabol@@ isation routes are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ el Solution for taking is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of p@@ ant@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster &quot; &quot; A@@ chi@@ eved &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution &quot; &quot; was used neither in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ el capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution for intake ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for inser@@ ting and low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ el is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous dosing can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent risk of 47 of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) are available methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in ble@@ ed@@ ings including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which may result in a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; increased by 50@@ 8 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with as@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase the associated adverse events associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am expects significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . it may not be used during pregnancy as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the propylene gly@@ co@@ l present ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s safety was investigated in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ a or any other medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed . &quot;
early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; a@@ gen@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with the child treated with PI . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large ve@@ to @-@ volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rabbit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; the use of the &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ el Solution to be used was not covered in patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors or with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
for the application low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( commonly used to reinforce the effect &#91; boo@@ sting &#93; of A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es ) along with A@@ gener@@ ase Solution for intake cannot be given dosage recommendations .

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of in@@ clin@@ ations in the genital area , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected skin surface , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were carried out either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ os .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p with immun@@ ological adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatments are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before going to bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream continues until all visible ti@@ lt war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the lesi@@ ons treated in the follow @-@ up examination were healed after 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is completely dra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , a weighing procedure should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
in these patients a weighing procedure should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with one to circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ k@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; until now , no clinical experiences are available for applying i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied tools for the treatment of external ti@@ lt war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral areas . &quot;
&quot; although limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ination reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown lesser efficacy in this group of patients regarding the elimination of the cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy , or reactions occur after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in case of super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs there are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tumours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ic places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after setting up treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
although neither after @-@ one nor after multiple topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been achieved no recommendation can be given for use during breast@@ feeding .
&quot; the most common adverse events , probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream in the studies with three @-@ week treatment , were local reactions in the treatment of the cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
among the most frequently reported and considered likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream in the context side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
&quot; reported side effects reported from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream , treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream , are shown below . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme in relation to the side effect , was in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
&quot; this assessment of the clinical signs shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ec@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / leaves ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this assessment of the clinical signs shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme very often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ formation and loss ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials evaluating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental initial absorption of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been demonstrated after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of the ti@@ lt in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is significantly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of the 119 patients who were treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the clin@@ chers healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five years of use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; results from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external ti@@ lt , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 @-@ 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks bz@@ w ) .
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated apparent half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application was low in the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat cases , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study conducted for four months on the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site in three days a week .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − When one of the listed side effects affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● Upper @-@ surface bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently encountered slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
&quot; if left untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to much sunlight during their previous lives .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in case of flat ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ os in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ otic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection with cow@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously applied al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about this before you get cured with the treatment . o A@@ void Al@@ dar@@ a cream until the area to be treated after a previous medication or surgical treatment . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o W@@ end the cream in@@ war@@ d. o Do not apply the cream as your doctor prescribed you . o Do not apply the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not using a band@@ age or band@@ age . o If reactions occur in the treated area that will give you strong in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are clari@@ fied , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleansing is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , swelling , fer@@ til@@ isation of the skin or difficulty can be expected when the fores@@ kin is removed . &quot;
&quot; do not use al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other drugs take serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area during the infection , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not previously ) is performed . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently used it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od prev@@ ails into breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of ti@@ lt war@@ ts , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and acute ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin place with the cow@@ war@@ ts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely dra@@ ined . &quot;
men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin have to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What must you consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream for 5 days per week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects ( with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( with less than 1 out of 10 patients to expect ) common side effects ( with less than 1 out of 1,000 patients to expect ) Very rare side effects ( with less than 1 out of 10,000 patients expected ) &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist about it immediately if you do not feel comfortable while using Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream any further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections ; it can cause a blue stain to occur with you or it can cause ti@@ redness .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you may feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
&quot; usually these are easier skin reactions , which disappear within about 2 weeks after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the application site ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , de@@ formation , skin irritation , bli@@ stering , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients suffer from changes to the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , diar@@ rhe@@ a , acute ker@@ at@@ ose , redness , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , lim@@ b pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the not neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to the brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study mainly studied the safety of the medicine , but it also measured its effectiveness ( by analy@@ sing its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be disclosed and , if necessary , update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who get Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to permit the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure were not determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effects that occur during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where re@@ covering facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the phase III clinical trial , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience of resum@@ ing treatment following a longer inter@@ ruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ thon ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Pro@@ ca@@ ine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ on with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk are present , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients enrolled in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing down@@ time and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe sequ@@ est@@ ration and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , with a more severe follow @-@ up of patients aged under 5 years compared to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( resp@@ . up to an early withdrawal from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no antibodies against immuno@@ hist@@ ochem@@ istry ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to server version . &quot;
patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody levels .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
&quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely of man@@ ate@@ 6 @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire range of disease , the majority of patients were of the central phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the anticipated value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the six @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to cope with the placebo group shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as emerged from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ hal@@ eg@@ aly treatment before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear decline of G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in 20 patients who were five years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe sequ@@ est@@ ration and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe sequ@@ ential form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe sequ@@ ential form there were limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional safety and toxic@@ ity studies , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; in the long term , this register will gather safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the constitu@@ ents of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction occurs on larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; an in@@ fusion reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 , &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicine containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicine , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
hints for handling - Dil@@ ution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical personnel ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ ated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • red@@ dening • hyper@@ ton@@ ia • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available every year , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was carried out under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , determine the number of di@@ lution bottles to be dil@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( anti @-@ cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy for chemotherapy alone . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; anti@@ thesis &quot; &quot; and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
&quot; the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form proceeds more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months for the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients previously receiving chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival times than with the comparison drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. to permit the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary doses is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - and advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid may be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage and after each third operating cycle .
&quot; in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge should be created before each application , including differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine green ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking account of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood @-@ image Na@@ di@@ rs or the maximal non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , therapy with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose duc@@ tions a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies showed no indication that in the age of 65 , patients with 65 years of age or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 have an increased risk of side effects . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on the safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical studies , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose modifications recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.@@ 0@@ x of the upper limit value ( if liver metast@@ ases were absent ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row suppression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; reduced toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was treated if pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed will need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ational anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is planned , should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergometer is to be considered before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 main cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasional , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible reduction of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment tin to get advice on sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
care must be taken when treating high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs are available with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and anti @-@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , unless it is necessarily required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed exists , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed enters the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .

&quot; clinical trials in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal epitheli@@ al nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
in clinical studies patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
it has been reported in cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy regi@@ mens ( see Section 4.4 ) .

&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ ency ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ amm@@ am@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) which are the key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful advantage of a survival of 2.8 months compared to patients with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in relation to the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC followed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; the mean PFS was 4,@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 28@@ ,@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = interval interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ c significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28@@ ,@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients needed sel@@ f@@ - ten the administration of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ de@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed after administration as a single agent were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is largely ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in urine within 24 hours of use . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs , who had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for nine months , diagnostic changes were observed ( de@@ generations / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; if not used un@@ excell@@ ently , the storage times and conditions after preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;

&quot; it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of fats that have been fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bow@@ el movement , bow@@ el strand , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , drau@@ ght o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( sw@@ ings ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition . &quot;
all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed to minimal absorption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic may be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional anti @-@ pregnancy measures to prevent the potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants combined with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) may be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at for up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take supplements of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after receiving a one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect inj@@ uri@@ ous effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are linked to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of reported side effects reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid return of possible systemic effects that can be traced back to the lip@@ ase @-@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is achieved in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active serum @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ s .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those participating who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average length of the waist was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable for 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at very low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without evidence of cop@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ rings ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume per day . &quot;
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; for which quantity is suitable for you , take a look at the information below that indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of operation , compliance with the recommended fat supply is decisive . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body can &apos;t handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related con@@ com@@ it@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; 34 . this reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low Physi@@ cal Ac@@ tivity &quot; means that you can work only little or not , climb stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium Physi@@ cal Ac@@ tivity &quot; means you exercise daily 150 k@@ cal , e.g. through 3 km walk , 30 @-@ 45 minutes garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 out of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd Company to approve the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in medi@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is required with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend towards such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in the days following chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ ies studied against tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zine , tur@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) did not have any significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience in the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least were associated with Alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
&quot; di@@ aly@@ sis studies have not been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is unlikely to be effective in case of alo@@ x over@@ dosing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life ) received intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study 6@@ 67 patients , who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with medi@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the study aimed at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption After IV administration , a gradual elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a gradual elimination of the body with an average half @-@ life of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ@@ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured in 11 testi@@ cular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) obtained at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro metabol@@ isation studies showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous cle@@ vis injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination rates and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were only observed after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficiently well above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicated that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to 30@@ fold of therapeutic exposure to humans ) which were given every day over two years led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the announcement of the approval for the marketing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ effective ingredient , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) Hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damages damages , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amino acid ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was inj@@ ected that stimulates the formation of the active substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( API structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted the CH@@ MP to announce the approval for the placing on the market ?
&quot; furthermore , concerns were raised to ensure that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting up treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease decreased again in more patients than with the reference drug ; additionally , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to investigate the extent to which the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected ladies ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ drug resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not have an effect against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ ung after the end of the treatment .
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin dogs , al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in the case of skin dogs , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it has been noted that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the surface of the order .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were out@@ weighed against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small loading rations , abra@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days are to be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is stopped , the o@@ int@@ ments are carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ in@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved in humans after topical application on abra@@ ded skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low system exposure to topical application in patients , dos@@ ages are not considered necessary if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate regarding a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to admini@@ ster systemic antibiotics .
the decision whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go had used , the most common reported side @-@ effect of irritation at the date of delivery was about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicate that the binding site is involved with the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in@@ ulin appear question@@ able at least some infection forms due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin were observed opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on isolated skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sample collection took place on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and the children aged 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of s@@ me@@ ared skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with less involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid disorders . &quot;
in @-@ vitro investigation of gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rats @-@ micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorisation must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is present , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the licensing agreement is committed to carrying out detailed studies and additional Pharma vi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the Pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for Professional products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP will also be submitted with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area will show you finish the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor .
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not specifically prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it should not be applied in the eyes , mouth or lips , nose or female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment comes out of view on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , cover the affected area with a sterile association or a ga@@ z@@ ant cover unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube containing a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium pou@@ ch containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ valent is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as eg for applying Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix protection was similar to a six @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix &apos;s most common side effects ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) include headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness , and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for basic di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is requested for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully assured , whether immun@@ ised persons , who responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her @-@ vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody level after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases there is no need for additional doses of vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ ed@@ ance , these injection channels should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ously as an exception , because in these cases intra@@ muscular administration may lead to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ ac and ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le @-@ influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ability , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s toler@@ ability was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ability on a calculation basis per imm@@ ac@@ ulate Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % of subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of mat@@ ernity , however , was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects that were given Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ability was low and comparable to the one observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old ino@@ cul@@ ations , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in combination with the three @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; at 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form @-@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the abl@@ ation rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher versus Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 , after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study for 1 @-@ 11 year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the ino@@ cul@@ ations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that , after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses , with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the ir@@ radiation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ ac and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us flood @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study , conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar serum and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions similar to the previous formulation . &quot;
&quot; the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing , to possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the government charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as water contaminated by water . &quot;
&quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series with 2 doses has been completed . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before administration of both ino@@ cul@@ ation doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections , which damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those associated with hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has already encountered an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose , and should give your child a vacc@@ ination protection against completion of the vaccine . &quot;
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected with persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of those individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child takes more medicine ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has been planned or planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as various extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix request inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; ♦ A very common ( more than 1 case per 10 t@@ inn@@ ed doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the in@@ stit@@ ch or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headache , lack of appetite &quot;
often ♦ s ( up to 1 case per 10 ino@@ cul@@ ated cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Head@@ light • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
&quot; other side effects reported on the day or week after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 missed doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or expanded r@@ ashes that can itch or be bli@@ stering , swelling of the eyes and the face , terri@@ fying breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and loss of consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like symptoms , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; &quot; ant @-@ run &quot; , &quot; multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will affect you / your child or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this pack .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP asser@@ ted that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , as Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia @-@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( cereb@@ ral damage caused by high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps - divided into several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without drug ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps may also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste sensation , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ aps had effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels in patients suffering from the ure@@ a cycle .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because only limited information about this drug was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use when there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carot@@ ene phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the origin of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate via the liver and kidneys is done , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the neur@@ onal proliferation was slow@@ ed down and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted to the mother &apos;s milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients suffering from the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of containing sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ag@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the earliest manifest@@ ations of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated permanently with sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet was the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is labeled with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ag@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycle disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the plasma next morning after night fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us Test , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no compla@@ ining effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours following oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nose probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carot@@ ene phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ de cells of the cor@@ tex cells occurred . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that the sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate rate taken from 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ag@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ule form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were noted .
&quot; during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium poly@@ but@@ yl rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the sti@@ cky waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you should not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , follow @-@ up of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room in your hospital to initiate the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin odor , rash , kidney dys@@ functions , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .

&quot; 31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife press over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ogen@@ esis is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ il@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ogen@@ esis in case of any administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ogen@@ esis - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - was as effective as the conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in was equally effective in all indicators such as he@@ par@@ in , except in severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ogen@@ esis should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients recently having ble@@ ed@@ ings , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attack . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ) with an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous drop of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient subsequently performs a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a drop of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV drop of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h , at least for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of Angi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT = 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before application and the captive bolt dose is administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , it is possible to admini@@ ster a second captive bolt of 0.3 mg / kg and to test the ACT for 5 minutes after the second dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ validation Bol@@ us without dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ parad@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial points of the arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion occur in PCI patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take war@@ far@@ in and be treated with bi@@ vali@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ validation is again achieved prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are checked regularly in each case . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies are inadequate regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ din alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ din plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ validation Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in treated patients over 65 years of age , more often than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ dine plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ A inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of the point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tual points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ din in 6000 patients , who undergo a PCI . &quot;
both in both the Bi@@ validation Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the comparison group than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ si@@ ties in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ogen@@ esis contains bi@@ vali@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as in the ani@@ on binding region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , with serum @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , did not indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients bio@@ vali@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is substanti@@ ated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if the patient subsequently performed a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were equally distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ogen@@ esis in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary ar@@ on@@ ar@@ s ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ din as a pe@@ p@@ tide has passed a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid components with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the division of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

&quot; based on conventional safety , toxic@@ ity , toxic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ity in animals by repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 @-@ times of the clinical steam @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm , or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not be processed effectively .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body of insulin can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study involving type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin exp@@ ir@@ ation . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ in or any other component , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or del@@ to@@ id muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change in effect , the brand ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ ar@@ ded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method may result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 . insufficient dosage or dis@@ continuation of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the time of the emergence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserves the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation should be weakened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ c@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin ulin passes into human breast milk , but in general insulin does not enter into breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are listed according to system organs and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold - sweat , cold and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dogs , headaches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in order to continuously change the injection point within the injection range , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; following a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ - tus , insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect in the therapeutic dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg , and 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ean effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that in an application of is@@ lan@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ inflammatory gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ ul@@ cer@@ ation was obtained 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin @-@ ul@@ cer@@ ation in administration for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin ul@@ cer@@ ation in administration for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ aise that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
