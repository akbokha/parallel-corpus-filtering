<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7,5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"• Whirling thoughts and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not available), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness in which the patients alternating with manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternate with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients responding to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or fusion tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are just like Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "neurotransmitters", "i.e. chemicals that allow the nerve cells to communicate with each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters, to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing her recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, the recovery of symptoms, was examined in three trials over to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which led to increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that led to increased restlessness caused by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment was examined."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and resorption to absorption (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received significantly stronger reductions in symptoms than those receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and, in addition to an existing treatment, was administered."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also significantly reduced the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders, acathisie (lack of movement), headache, blurred vision, secretion (increased salivation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweighed the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, were outweighed against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the incidence of suicidal behavior is related to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conductive disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesired cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to combined entities, the use of antipsychotics in which weight gain is known as a side effect, and may lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effects of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution must be taken when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered together with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphic / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (alextromethorphic)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and the concerns produced in the reproductive studies of the animal, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"adverse events related to an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death succession."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5G 2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity with the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HTC receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in the case of Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for more than 2 weeks to healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, the Nucleus caudatus and the putty."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) with 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of respondents with a response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study lasting 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole did not show superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, in week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium and haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients, who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazl showed itself superior to the prevention of bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and hydroxystimulation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkyung is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationary period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole on extensive metabolizers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">There was no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"one single dose study in subjects with varied liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"the preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans based on conventional safety, toxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no significance for the clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>

<seg id="864">"Actraphane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas can produce no insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is unable to use the insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"in the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c mirror indicating that the blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actraphane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane in the treatment of diabetes were outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">"in October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S a licence for the placing of Actraphane in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can change the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change in strength, brand (manufacturer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analogue) and / or production method (due to recombinant DNA against insulin-animal origin) may cause a change in dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dose adjustment is required when changing to actraphane in the patient, this can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the changeover."</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">"before trips that go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times."</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and his patients will always ask for other medications taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia may however develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycaemia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sugar-containing foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have glucose pieces, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias involving loss of consciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose which is intravenously given by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect begins within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fissures (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the division is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">"based on conventional safety therapeutics, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans."</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after removing the Actraphane gas bottle from the fridge - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is used for the first use in accordance with the operating instructions.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clung."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be followed by the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 days treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated using a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in examining all haystack symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerobaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients taking pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"when only the swelling of the mucosa was considered, the patients with Aerobaze showed a reduction in the symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in the patients who received Desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerobaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), tachycardia, dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, tiredness, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="2635">"the study aimed at 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG effects of palonosetron administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"resorption After IV administration, a gradual elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a gradual elimination of the body with an average half-life of about 40 hours."</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μg / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">"after intravenous Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration measured in 11 testicular cancer patients was 42 ± 34%."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"in pharmacokinetic simulations, the total composition (AUC0- ∞) obtained at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to that measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after the one-off dose of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro metabolisation studies showed that CYP2D6 and CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after a unique intravenous clevis injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"although in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination rates and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in preclinical studies, effects were only observed after exposures, which are considered sufficiently well above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 of preclinical studies indicated that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and can prolong the duration of action."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to 30fold of therapeutic exposure to humans) which were given every day over two years led to increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pankreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the announcement of the approval for the marketing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug-effective ingredient, which is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference drug" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) Hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in a microscopic examination the liver tissue damages damages, and the values of the liver enzyme alanine amino acid (ALT) are increased in the blood."</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was injected that stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon presented data showing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (API structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were raised to ensure that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">"the number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting up treatment with Alpheon, the disease decreased again in more patients than with the reference drug; additionally, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the extent to which the medicine forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected ladies (crack or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections which have been demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillindrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not have an effect against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was clung after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">"119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin dogs, altargo and cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together in the case of skin dogs, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it has been noted that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the surface of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweighed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small loading rations, abrasions or stitched wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days are to be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in case of sensitizing or severe local irritation due to the use of Retapamine ointment, the treatment is stopped, the ointments are carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retinapinulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been achieved in humans after topical application on abraded skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 According to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazol, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased after topical application of 1% Retapamine ointment on skinned skin of healthy adult men by 81%."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low system exposure to topical application in patients, dosages are not considered necessary if topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate regarding a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamulin is preferable to administer systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo had used, the most common reported side-effect of irritation at the date of delivery was about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved with the ribosomales protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibit peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50 ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should the application of Retapaminulin appear questionable at least some infection forms due to the local prevalence of resistance, advice should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin were observed opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamine ointment was applied daily with occlusion on intact and on isolated skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"from 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamine ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample collection took place on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and the children aged 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of smeared skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2709">"the in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with less involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid disorders."</seg>

<seg id="2712">"there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 smeared skin):"</seg>
<seg id="2713">"in an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined."</seg>
<seg id="2714">"the owner of the marketing authorisation must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system is present, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied."</seg>

<seg id="2723">"ambivalent is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be completed from two doses."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose is requested against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defences) as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" foreign "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as eg for applying Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of Ambirix protection was similar to a six-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"Ambirix's most common side effects (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) include headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matchiness, and irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for basic dimmunisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresher vaccination is requested for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not fully assured, whether immunised persons, who responded to hepatitis A vaccination, need a refresher-vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form-ininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in the case of hemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody level after priming, so that in these cases there is no need for additional doses of vaccination."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impedance, these injection channels should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may be injected subcutanously as an exception, because in these cases intramuscular administration may lead to bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"when Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyeliac and haemophile-influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1)."</seg>

<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carotene phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>

<seg id="2821">"each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium-phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose."</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm, or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisine differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where the body of insulin can not work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin expiration."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisin or any other component, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdomen."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change in effect, the brand (normal, NPH, zinc retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method may result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3. insufficient dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the emergence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, propoxyphene, salicylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta-blockers, clonidin, Guanethidin and reserves the symptoms of the adrenergic counterregulation should be weakened or absent."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"in order to continuously change the injection point within the injection range, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias involving loss of consciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucoagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"following a glucoagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the subcutaneous gait of insulin lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m- tus, insulin-ulisin showed a disproportionate glucosal effect in the therapeutic dosage range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg, and 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosean effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisine has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that in an application of islanisin 2 minutes before the meal, a similar post-inflammatory glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
