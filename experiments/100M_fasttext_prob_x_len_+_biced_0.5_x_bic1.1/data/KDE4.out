&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot;
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Exten@@ sions .... Open the card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of default configuration modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have installed additional software .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Extras Ab@@ ort . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the module Rec@@ ei@@ ving Filter ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Con@@ View Filter . you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools to view DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps grants the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; for &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the hierarchy hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area of child rec@@ tan@@ gles shall be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the inscription in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ aps for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . frames are drawn to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and that frame will need space that is not available to the subordin@@ ate entries . &quot;
&quot; how parti@@ tioning the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoiding space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles arise that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View An@@ gled on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , which allows you to set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a turn field to set the number of mini images in each row in the gallery .
&quot; to view the file name of the image in the picture box , specify whether the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; to view the file size of the image , see if the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
indicate whether the size of the images is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where to store the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up with a slider or a script to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; to copy the original pictures with the check box , you can copy the original images to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the comment text box , you can specify a comment file for the let@@ tering of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &quot; &quot; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; menu ; view the menu under the navigation area or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition , you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the default browser id of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser id in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser id to run with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly represented with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pe@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , review and correct your photos . editing skills can easily be expanded with K@@ DE image plugin interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam , easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens that can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and opportunities for improvement . &quot;
&quot; if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , users and developers might help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to join &amp; edit ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; when you first start , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a collection of images on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be modified . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . this lets you insert a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not take pictures as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera ; then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word List to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , you may also be able to handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Centre support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pe@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras , which supports a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras , also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam , by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; moving and dropping images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that you can &apos;t put an image in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view . so the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame will only work if this ind &apos;s icon view is also displayed . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ign .
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ve@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which are stored by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also copy or copy multiple photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums so you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you will be used to sort your photos after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections . &quot;
&quot; the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums , sort by date . &quot;
&quot; buttons El@@ ders , Me@@ an , New : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ eper . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait for a short while while the thumb@@ nail images are generated . this can be avoided by re@@ producing all preview images in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the associated preview . what information these are , you can edit via Settings ; set up . select the Albums tab here and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse po@@ inter rest for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the key words of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
&quot; photos are all about digi@@ ti@@ zed ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to these . you can choose from the view of the images , a slide show or the editing of the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open image editing with a photo by either editing the F@@ 4 image ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... . in the editing pane , you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after editing other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur . some programs do not store this data with , if you save the changed image . this will cause this information from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to right click on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organizes your photos according to the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . hereby you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; collapse , so that you can find the key words you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords , right @-@ click on &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New Key@@ word . if you have a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ sample of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word quot ; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select the album preview in the contex@@ tual menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze s functionality with keywords , you first have to put your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you have selected with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word &apos; . alternatively , you can also right click on the preview of the images and select keyword ( s ) from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords allocated to it . in this way , you can select a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was done etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have finished a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove from the menu . the menu only shows the tags assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom of the box below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future . &quot;
&quot; if you click on it , the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which will always filter what you entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in My Search list in View My Search List . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just have to select the respective entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you select to edit search , the search form will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select to edit an advanced search , the dialog for the advanced search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced Search tool section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . all rules are displayed in line by operators separated , added . an option can be added with others via the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows it to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar items : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . using a sw@@ ell@@ erts , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : free @-@ hand colour sket@@ ches : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; find the matching images . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini Program . you can use the mouse wheel in or zo@@ oming out or moving it . move it while you press the left mouse button . move it while you click the left mouse button .
in the box below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window is opened . if you are back in the window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras light table . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to preview a preview from the tool@@ bar , and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use pairs navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the fields . use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it in the right @-@ hand side . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nail images . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you have to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area . &quot;
zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom regulator under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zo@@ oming out . this happens in both pictures when you are synchron@@ ized in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the f@@ law ? digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records and scans or stores digital photos leads to a form of digital continu@@ ance management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam . we look at the downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , re@@ viewing , group@@ ing , backing , optimi@@ zing , waiting and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition of data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you probably don &apos;t need to use any specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use the metadata in both a database and image files to access very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you take care of anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide if you want to have access to your photos , whether you want to store it on a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes stack processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend to save the metadata option in the file &apos;s settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be added to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album Menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos when working . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often name in other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or add the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are followed by &amp; digi@@ kam , while keeping the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how to get your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dre@@ aming , having associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now goes with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; you can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . with the Google Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ s came ; should be deposited as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you provide the picture to others . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer any protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators can delete or modify these , in the picture . for private individuals this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk defect , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs they must be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously and you may no longer be trusted than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it lies in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not essentially more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store in a clean , dark dry and protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disc@@ la@@ akers are keeping your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s capabilities include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : flo@@ ppy disk &quot;
&quot; shortly , disks will last the longest if you run in temperature ranges from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In the case of lower temper@@ ance , the error rate increases dramatically . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also restore data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not matter much , the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money . &quot;
the most common protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should pay attention to the fact that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sp@@ outs which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a multitude of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in electricity disrup@@ tions with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; Euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference when you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember to tr@@ ash all cables before going on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can include it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; compared to hard drives , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . due to the TCP protocol , data transmission errors are automatically cleaned up and with large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are secure . &quot;
&quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs , at least , provide the data integrity between operating system and hard drive . &quot;
&quot; the worst thing about it is that no one is telling you when a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle sheet errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system , which is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms using Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % in desktop systems . not@@ ebooks are already 50 % of th@@ ef@@ ts .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or re @-@ installation . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minim@@ ally better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result rather wor@@ sens . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . so , backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous such as the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite f@@ use is panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to backup . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which one such backup has been made . this backup comes next with the exception that is only sam@@ pled and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
save important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the same time , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retained original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures survive the next 40 year that is about the time span you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable based on your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to for@@ ge a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have entered the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk :
&quot; check the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new disk has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; Res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of the call if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there is no more software available one day , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ it and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relatively many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow compression . &quot;
TI@@ FF has been widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( de@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . a problem is however that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore over 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital negative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed due to the need to uni@@ fy the camera body formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing D@@ NG and we hope to use it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block ; technology of the &apos; 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is saved with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera , you can use this as a temporary f@@ use . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ layer editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were under certain circumstances cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in section adding a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . for some cameras it can take a while . if the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the Pages Properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam , so downloading the pictures will not be deleted and we advise you to check if the pictures are safe in an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the selection with the default selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded yet . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use the Find All or Un@@ selected buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums section . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; edit ; load the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you just want to delete some , then you have to select them first and then delete the chosen ones . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos you have deleted from the camera ; the photos will not be removed from the camera &apos;s sleeve ; therefore , you should carefully check if the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so via the camera &apos;s menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can cause double file names , if you upload photos of different recording series to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options which will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the information about the author in the section of Standard Aut@@ ory Identi@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the ex@@ if information will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % % H : % M : % S . turn on the date &amp; time option for further adjustments . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the option camera file name , you have the option of changing the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you next time open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the camera &apos;s orientation to the point of view , to enable automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the metadata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . these sub @-@ albums are based on the image data . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer on your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is completed , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be loaded up . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document that aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings , and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module . &quot;
&quot; there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the length and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters of ha@@ iry coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle , for example . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; there are lots of settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you must select the settings dialog . to access these settings , you must select the settings dialog . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be previ@@ ew@@ ed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ join ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s profession . this can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a closer description of the author field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this will ensure that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digi@@ code database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ code ; it can be imported without being lost .
&quot; save cap@@ tions as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse po@@ inter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; attempt to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; when you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings can be switched on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better visibility results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with P@@ NG comp@@ ressing setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , because P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image files need more time to expand and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality as the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
&quot; saving los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files allows you to save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings . &quot;
&quot; the default size is that all green pixels are the same . when using this option , if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference generates a grid pattern in the output . this option ren@@ ders the picture a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default , it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top scores . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top @-@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as continuous white . use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results , because they are the top lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . so , d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ code ; image processing . to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that come from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reproduction .
&quot; there are three alternatives available : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ously @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ ding correction , as it is carried out during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ code ; information such as colour information from a color space in the other to be translated means that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Issu@@ es when an image is opened in image editing / start the color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; Def@@ ault squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , who do not have color mapping or g@@ amma correc@@ tions . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must do the mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your picture can be restored from one device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon &apos;s profile extension lets you see the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plug @-@ in Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by providing this interface &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sing ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short instructions for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained through the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the slide control settings should be easy to understand . the upper controls adjust the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes activate the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images at the bottom of the display . &quot;
&quot; camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left . on the right side there is a button Auto Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set the camera model and port manually . if not , you can set the camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the Main Window System menu . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog option for moving &gt; Pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the dialog of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly applied by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the digi@@ ti@@ sed welcome screen ; when starting , this speeds up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed the start process . &quot;
&quot; the Set@@ ting Up after new photos searches &amp; digi@@ kam ; searches the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something from the base folder has been deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam , used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar in settings design . a preview of the available designs is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , contains a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry A@@ ds / Edit . &quot;
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; some of them may not be part of your distribution . you may find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image editing section .
&quot; status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar on the upper edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
editing functions of image editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file saving or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button from the File menu or using the Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
&quot; almost any image editing action can be und@@ one or restored , the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Rec@@ over or Rest@@ art by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should take the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the back button or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom in in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can also edit the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can view this in the editing dialog of &amp; digi@@ pe@@ . see the section for setting the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . entire picture pages can be printed from your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer wizard . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navigation arrows , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab makes the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the border again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on it , either use the Apply button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the Application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , keyword tree and a drop @-@ down box with keywords previously applied in this file ; session used key words . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can limit the number of options in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering a picture series . if you have entered several keywords , it will be stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by checking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the Key@@ word Filter side bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . typically , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears that asks you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be disabled in settings different .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the rule area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can specify an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the outcomes it wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
they work on a monitor calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( for more information see below )
&quot; their only other picture titles are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another colour space and that you have to think about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB so@@ iling compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to install my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to install your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that you are al@@ lied to s@@ RGB . if you are working as in the color space of s@@ RGB , you either have to use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , compare , Automati@@ cally adjust and contrast from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try to make the best out of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the distortion values across the entire image , so the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor in the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a re @-@ ji@@ ving of all values in between . this is only visible in the images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is a bit limited because it is possible to work over a color space with 8 bits per color . so if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ron@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry color white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be customized in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original image again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the target image preview has a red marker . the pixel lumin@@ ance below this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful here , even in well lit images , most pixels are displayed very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you enhance or even dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above @-@ mentioned controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if over a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this will be displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file , and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . in doing so , also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . t@@ int mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to adjust your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the tool color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , it was called &quot; &quot; Solar@@ isation &quot; , &quot; also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created by inver@@ ting a partially developed print with a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the development of the image . the result was that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot;
&quot; intensity controls solar activity . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ is@@ ation@@ effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and hot .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the O@@ k button and you are applied .
&quot; if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ k@@ force / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the application described here . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected area . under the graph three slide controls are cli@@ cked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls , and take care of how the image changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , based on the image settings , updated . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear narrative is most often dominated . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the upper@@ most for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background , while something else is to be seen in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and rel@@ o@@ aded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shades , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator control checks all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode produces a wide bar . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a vent@@ ral arrow to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels will become darker . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : you can do exactly that with these buttons . any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ view In@@ dic@@ ator option checks all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will see the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison over one &apos;s own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you are using the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , since the channel mixer is then the tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator control checks all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . preserve the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography black / white is a step in which color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film imaging with a green l@@ enti@@ cular filter . this looks good with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film imaging with an orange l@@ enti@@ cular filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film imaging with a red l@@ enti@@ cular filter . this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simulate moon light scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white filter line with a yellow l@@ enti@@ cular filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ qui@@ z@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ ec@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture in the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) see . the relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer on the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . going through the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a Kno@@ pp@@ p effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its characteristics as you need . &quot;
&quot; each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed any more . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool Tem@@ plate apply you can lay a template over a picture .
the menu image template use in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template file , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ code ; mailing list digi@@ code @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder was set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder refresh@@ es the preview bar of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge This button magni@@ fies the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture you have to decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact it sharp@@ ens no bit ; it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright of Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digital@@ ised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process colors must be combined with minimal differences to a color point . this in turn leads to blur@@ red edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots on paper are printed . SL@@ R cameras normally require more sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners alter a field of sharp@@ ness already during the image reading . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry to access Cor@@ rec@@ t Do@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; however , you should be careful because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus . you will find further more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus on . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to make the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the picture . the preview window displays the filter &apos;s output with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried out . an increase in radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image one that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus , one can define a minimal difference thus for an edge of the filter applied . thus , areas with a soft change between shades are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore avoid beauty defects in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focusing a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected dra@@ fting @-@ filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to focus an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing quot ; in which it revers@@ es the de@@ focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ming . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focusing results usually achieve better results than blur@@ ring in image editing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical results also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharpen@@ ing : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality will be very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further dev@@ ise the image . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness gauge is sch . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharpen@@ ing or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to do all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; in general , sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ ring of mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , un@@ sharp masks always have to create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter , it is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of correction correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the knob regul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want a blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools for removing unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the Ri@@ der smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed er@@ ect p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the picture . whereas larger values are mainly homo@@ geneous regions smooth@@ ing and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing should be subsequently subordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; direction dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ s evenly in all directions while a value is smooth@@ ed near to 1 . if you have a film gra@@ ft or CCD noise , a high value will create wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG &apos;s arti@@ facts are best removed with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ y. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to match the degree of intoxic@@ ation in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is tra@@ vers@@ ed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ step length &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let it out . &quot;
the K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les Save as and Lo@@ ad do exactly this . correc@@ ting any image errors can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the cancel button . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts are corrected . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact created in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a proprietary algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed using this tool .
&quot; below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value controls the pixel spac@@ ing . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the max@@ im , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process of the image controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the image controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically stronger . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters of the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ omet@@ ry , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture replacement is done with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for the restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les Save as and Lo@@ ad make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot;
below you can reduce how a photo with uniform noise reduction is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark photo sub@@ tract method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark icon button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . &quot;
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbour pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all the faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ sing ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en- quot ; ( shad@@ y ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed in such circumstances that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should , even with center filters , use an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or less , since otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the wide exposure of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter using an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker &apos;s copyright . &quot;
&quot; with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection filter and with three more exposure to the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density . the standard density is 2,0 , resulting in an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , . increase density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; pixel Str@@ ength , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a Leu@@ ch@@ amp and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of 4 dig@@ its correc@@ ts the distant corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the second degree of distortion . with negative values , sound @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite character of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ ets the image size and causes a correction for the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
clear : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the Pre@@ view dialog shows the distortion parameter . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ ne or cushion distortion should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or res@@ izing changes . the best way to perform this correction is to perform this correction first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the groove . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Trans@@ form cro@@ pping from image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some subjects like photographs from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ne correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u.@@ org web site which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters of film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Add @-@ Movie option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of the film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top conductors .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Filter Film Rec@@ ei@@ ving is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ined effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited version ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better for large images . smooth@@ ing checks the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editor is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen yourself to sketch out . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 are used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter engra@@ ver shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; laser engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses proprietary algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture here is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the Stop button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses proprietary algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; zoom In@@ gre@@ dients : blur@@ red the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a centre point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera , thereby producing a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : blur@@ ts the image by rotating the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ sharpen@@ ing : blur@@ red the image by a random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the picture into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
&quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the Stop button . &quot;
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n &apos;s proprietary algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images .
&quot; you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ code ; image processing will keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be found in the Transform@@ ers Tur@@ ning or transforming mirror menu . &quot;
blowing photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of picture quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and hold the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information ? try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo shows the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; retain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as a text file , and then rel@@ o@@ aded later . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast in what it does , but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows you to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag it with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save file or save it in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; below in the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible degree depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the edit tool next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the compilation help make it possible to hide help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonious ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third angel rule , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of its two previous numbers . &quot;
the golden middle provides more fluid support lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; in comparison to the third angel , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the above mentioned golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can cause a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the color button , you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo then it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences knob you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown at the top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers Cut out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut function . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the turn , but note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get im@@ percep@@ tible tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cro@@ pping out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal loop , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not rotation , the picture is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the sea , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single lubrication , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two form@@ ulations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cro@@ pping out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that know . this is based on the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the file extension is included in the file editing , you can edit this list of file extensions . see the configuration section for more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . thereby , redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour for very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF by using the &amp; digi@@ code raw image converter . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . hereby , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supporting cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats provided by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
many digital cameras support recording short movies . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understands these formats and will therefore generate previ@@ ews for the movies .

&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . on the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper part shows the original and the lower the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and place on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . previ@@ ew@@ ing in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini Program . you can use the mouse wheel in or zo@@ oming out or moving it . move it while you press the left mouse button . move it while you click the left mouse button .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to manipul@@ ate color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the Pal@@ ettes files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can be applied either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folder for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described below the palette view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor under the button color is activated , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that contain &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs with only a few functions are available . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ art viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; posters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph@@ ene in &amp; posters ; the graph re@@ counts and in &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; in a &amp; posters ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
&quot; additional required software : &amp; k@@ art viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool and dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ s . requires in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the screen@@ shot below : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the contex@@ tual menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ alo@@ viewer ; set up ... see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph@@ ite file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ ven@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ ven@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this can also be changed with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your selection as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely selected .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without header and another font
the renewal page gives you the option to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or let the program check every time .
the page opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ alo@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened out of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the Se@@ at Management page gives you the option to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ alo@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files at the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up other possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . entries , as described on the website of &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge @-@ edges as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ er@@ ased graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the jump spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used that is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for treating large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node in a circular way according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as parameter , and use the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the -@@ mouse po@@ inter . with this mouse po@@ inter click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source repository &apos;s root folder .
&amp; k@@ art viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for display . it requires the following program packages :
&quot; a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; create a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon will be created from a template , or whether you want to start anew from scratch . &quot;
&quot; restore the last revers@@ ed step . if you did not undo any step , this function is disabled . &quot;
adds the cli@@ p@@ board content as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors that do not match with those of the icon palette of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
&quot; not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color on the color of the point you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x and y coordinates of the current drawing area , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the cli@@ p@@ board content as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by adding ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you can also set the size : the Kar@@ os on Small , Medium and Large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module can read images to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears as you can replace the default duc@@ er custom to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range of your needs before you scan the image with the button scanning . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
after pressing the button scanning you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the menu Im@@ porting &gt; Screen shot . a window appears in which you can set the different screen photo@@ modes :
select the complete desktop to read in to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long the screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box will appear with the options described above . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; this module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for the comfortable navigation . also , the option Auto@@ Play for Windows platforms is available . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and other capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show your photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world to present the photos of your camera and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . so , it is used for your authentication , so it is virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is launched so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you following a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . to upload , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button &quot; &quot; Add photos &quot; &quot; should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you click on the O@@ k button , you start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as tags during high @-@ loading .
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly options , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed prior to upload in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is modified so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image , and the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Cor@@ Rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to perform a possible correlation about time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that shows coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
&quot; the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from a location for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialogue takes the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , choose the region and magni@@ fy it . choose this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
this module has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be adapted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . you can quickly select a large number of albums with the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side . in the section below will appear the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text of the HTML page in the header .
&quot; the tab defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to display the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after startup , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses in quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please check out exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tool and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG format , then you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the images or content of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , high contrast , very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file using the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all the settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic suggests that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tool and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button below . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect it to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option is whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch doesn &apos;t have any effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise use it later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality gets worse . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . so use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . however , this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , start number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . there are four types of image change available :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen size . &quot;
non @-@ proportional : dispro@@ portion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; pre@@ press : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ Mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you pres@@ elect . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . a preview on the right @-@ hand side will be displayed for the last selected image . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add them to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the Edit button , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are already attached as attachment .
most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails to be sent . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and added to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG pictures in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original file data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced slide show , a window appears with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL pass option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are shown in a random order . so it does not use the order of the images in the album .
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random chooses a different effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left corner of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in writing , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse through them , see picture . how you can see through a comparison with the image are now available in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the record button , the browser view changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; when you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can mit &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save your own preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture for this . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right outside of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this , you will need to open the image for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the image preview window ( in closer description ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the search entry in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total dat@@ as , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , you can see images on which Jes@@ per , however , are not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try similar features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; view the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date is displayed in the preview ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . if you select an area , only images of this time period are displayed in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will be described , which you can create via the menu file HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
first enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is to be created ; export file is to be created on the overview page . find more information about the export files in .
&quot; finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; on the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images , so those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not download any more pictures , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you will need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible to the viewer . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to them . to enable the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the adjustment possibilities described above have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you can set in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to share your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time to fill in the picture information , people on the pictures , recording location etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not go again . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file , or whether in the file is only a link to images . the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file is so independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches out the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can view via the File Export menu . &quot;
the main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available for you :
&quot; if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal zip files . since most pictures were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so please simply select the Export file option .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file im@@ porting ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard will consist of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the im@@ porting images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you select the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported , and which categories will correspond in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) Set the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the browsing and view , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; if you want to start another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
about the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can access a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the different settings are explained .
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings for preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing the F1 button and click on the option you want . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select an inscription and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of one group at one time in a group , rather than all groups of a group as explained in . &quot;
in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&quot; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of several applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures . demo database can be either accessed via the command line using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications using K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simulate &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to deliver a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will do so , so if you have selected people to view and pass on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and choose the modules to load modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . at the moment , there is not much information , as you do not yet have information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image has been recorded etc . you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are m@@ apped on all 50 images , you can find that the names used are moved up to find people faster and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image , you may want to edit all selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , just click on the above and back buttons that are located at the top right of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have added several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a super @-@ group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry into a category and place there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this assumes you just sort your categories in alphabetical order . &quot;
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it out of the window area .
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options ... button that provides you with the option to save the current setup and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to display this window again later , use the Options ... and here window to hide . see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or of all images if you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; in the preview window , you can also delete images . simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button , or select Edit menu in the Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures showing the right upper corner are not saved on the disk . however , the thumb@@ nail images are present for the images 5 @-@ 9 , so that you can preview these pictures . you can also preview these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if so , don &apos;t support them to insert the respective CD . so , if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance how to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that in the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible and click on Ac@@ tual View All the pictures that your little sister may see , ta@@ ch and choose the menu entry Every@@ thing other than current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which pictures should be hidden in case of case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures lock , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click unlock lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply choose password change in the Privacy Menu . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read out or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , has an image _ and video viewer . you can start it from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the image , but additional all information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the top of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with your mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether you want to see information at all . all of these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and below . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often there is a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you are using the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom in the middle of the image . &quot;
&quot; with the dot key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the DC key , you set the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work with videos are that in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the main functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can ann@@ ot@@ ate ann@@ ot@@ ations to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you view images , it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . at the moment you can view the look and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to preview the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you look one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in , you see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in the browser . you can see this in the browser . so if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you select categories in dre preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to paint on the picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
in you can view a picture on the painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select View on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ em@@ eler ; work , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should be absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete , either from the Edit menu or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message with an error description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click on the button again or reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a point of view as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected , or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , take the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card leaders at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are pending views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing left at the top of the cham@@ fer bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can paste additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any position . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with View window order ... save . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu entry View Sc@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode comp@@ lies with the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select View modes in the View View menu , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can type any name , but useful is a name that lets you know the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can set the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields . &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties that are used by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally images with this feature look better .
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the default is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling involves the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is repeat@@ able depending on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) will be charged extra pixels per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays do not hit the object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly terminated , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not full command scope of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you don &apos;t support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , just highlight the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
&quot; by copying and past@@ ing into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the paint for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the Color for the Control Points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views will be further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you activate edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders , it explains how to create and store window orders . &quot;
drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new order can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all the views for the chosen window arrangement . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten . create a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a ball at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed everything error @-@ free you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bar icons . read the documentation , so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols many times , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit Del@@ ete . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points , with which you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; when you press the Apply button or the En@@ ter button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a fa@@ der ( insert End@@ able Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an aw@@ k@@ ward method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; in fact offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the En@@ ter button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , if at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you view the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the icon + before the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the object &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog where you can choose how to paste the object . please select first sub@@ object . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities again , but now take the easiest . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on the Qu@@ ader and the ball in the preview window , just click on the Application button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one @-@ colored each time and change the colors in the object &apos;s view : &quot;
you should already be able to perform this step as you should have understood the basic approach of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
&quot; in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the application button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as at the bottom , give the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click Ball pigment , then select Uni@@ color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the lu@@ str@@ e effect and reflection already give in part good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal is not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you can offer you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to produce a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have saved the model already , it is saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ed command . you can select this menu entry only if you have used undo .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . using this option , you can change commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; change commands or add new ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . with this option , you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands . &quot;
&quot; a pump @-@ map is a way to pre @-@ emp@@ t rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis by using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s button or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Mach@@ ining and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slideshow should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
shows large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
magni@@ fies the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ snap@@ ; an open source project . this means that the user will be able to report at least problems and possible improvements .
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and requests . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to post your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ snap@@ ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ snap@@ shots , then we encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ snap@@ . in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
the best start to join &amp; show photo ; join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ snap@@ ; .
&quot; there are many options that will change the behavior of &amp; show@@ snap@@ . in order to access these settings , you must select the settings dialog photo . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicators section you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . skill@@ fully , the colors should be in contrast with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and exposure to a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ snap@@ ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also view the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save .
&quot; &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save . &amp; channels ; for each image , open a dialog to save or save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite , with the command chan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ inea ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options special .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan for scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
&quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be shown in a preview window , as shown below . when saving , the image will be saved and par@@ sley will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the dialog of the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview will have to be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the way you want to save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , you will need to select Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the option Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and setting short commands ... select the short@@ cut . &quot;
you may set up existing multimedia buttons to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command @-@ line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use k@@ alo@@ gues , so that the user can see why a script is not running . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . to do this , strings will be written to the default scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events when there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to show the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece queries ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be used . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script pack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permission : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and yet is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you will find only a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Collec@@ ting Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can you never decide which one you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still find it hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many more useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . &quot;
&quot; typically , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled for them to be used . for details please refer to System requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; amar@@ oc , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the playlist window is displayed ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . this option turns off the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
shaping the mood : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; disc@@ ard m@@ oods in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be launched when a browser is needed .
&quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you &apos;re finished &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , the playlist window will roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area . &quot;
changing to context @-@ Browser shows automatically the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the Fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using proprietary scripts , the otherwise gray section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window , and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have even the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ections to be activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; resume play at startup , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the place with which it has been stopped at the last exit . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color spaces opens the dialog to choose color sel@@ ector . if your own colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
&quot; the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can decide on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD will appear . &quot;
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop@@ down box . some drivers activate additional settings in this card card .
&quot; the card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection . &quot;
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with selected folders . &quot;
recur@@ sively Browse sub@@ folders : this will cause &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse the files as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another device is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : to enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under port : the network port is entered under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece whenever needed .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can access the list in the context @-@ Browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to install k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager considers the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also add the broken file that caused the crash . afterwards you can delete the file and leave the collection again .
this is mostly due to the fact that tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of your libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email will open automatically when a crash occurs ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; doesn &apos;t exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re @-@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Symb@@ ols in the Status Bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click on a symbol in the control center under Ap@@ pear@@ ance symbols . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map then please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . you can do this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version , or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . they can also help other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only wear a bug there if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do you get pieces of music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column display evaluation . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to determine the rating for a piece . you can also use the short instructions Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select Del@@ ete from the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do it with other files . &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the add button , the playlist will be stored . click on it . &quot;
&quot; you probably lack the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it on the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end @-@ independent approach , so the actual question must be : what media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ ng ! &quot;
&quot; you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with no MP3 deco@@ ders included in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you might need to provide another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you want a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound Server with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning : see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x issues problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause distorted playback . read this bug report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the following config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up from the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to know current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ p d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size change@@ over .
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the mouse sequence into the queue . by pressing the En@@ ter button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the symbol in the control bar system section ? &quot;
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser should be displayed .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what then ?
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , sc@@ rolling F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ string ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can set the evaluation for a piece itself by clicking on a column header in the playlist window with the right mouse button . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : selecting the rating or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog . &quot;
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release schedule that is not to bring together with the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can easily find annoying . disable the option icon at play anim@@ ating in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool boxes to set up ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install it .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid any difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the Fol@@ der Start menu .
audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also a lot of bug reports . &quot;
&quot; probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install it . &quot;
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install a distribution that separates the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . you must now install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without drinking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module must also be the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module installed . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then perform as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
&quot; set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output to enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type ho@@ v card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w @-@ audio { type h@@ w @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the dialog box of x@@ ine , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ mark on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio edition with Arts won &apos;t be taken care of . of course , you can take this problem by yourself ! if you like , you can become the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; to create a playlist is very easy . drag the mouse to the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier for you to search for specific pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them by clicking the playlist in the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist has been included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select action audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files to the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right click on an entry and follow the Bur@@ n menu . you have several options for burning a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition &amp; Amar@@ ok ; but a playlist that is superior to all others . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection .
&quot; this chapter will explain how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok will be used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sample rate of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the pane with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also activated . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control , and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context @-@ Browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpretation . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece on each of the different aspects . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ windows startup has dropped off . the information displayed there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statisti@@ cs window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover artwork of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to look at the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng formats are supported . the images can have any name but images with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display covers images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
&quot; you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . with the right mouse button , click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you don &apos;t have a text script yet , you can choose which to start . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and there will be another arrangement according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack @-@ albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list below Vari@@ ous performers . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted to interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will be sorted by genre , among them by artist . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just as the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in tree view alike . you will find hints about using this filter in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; there are various time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . you can also select your entire collection , so the filter will be switched off practically . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order .
app@@ endi@@ x to Play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ es - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / Bur@@ n CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a composition and it appears under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ters .
&quot; undo the compilation marker - change an album marked as a compilation into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown under Vari@@ ous performers , but again under the associated interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the playlist browser is designed to handle many play@@ lists easily . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these smart play@@ lists use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; also self @-@ created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok , with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it needs to be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press enter button , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simple dropping . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert the drop @-@ in files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag the entries into the desired place and drop . over the playlist is a text box in which you can enter a filter . once you enter characters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three are found ( or combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example , review : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variations at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment pool .
&quot; you can set the order sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then clicking the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , you can rever@@ t back and restore the buttons , so you can rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window using the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and set up tool@@ bars there ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all the pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the window visualization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big collection in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok will play ; 1 is played first , 2 as a second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already pre @-@ specified ( the details to set up these later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , and add more random pieces while playing . &quot;
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double @-@ click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced with the new one . so you should save the old playlist in some circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix will immediately fill in your playlist and you can directly start playing . the play@@ lists will start with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . via the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled . &quot;
the New Fil@@ l button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist editing opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed in respect of the settings played . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can select from pre @-@ existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you want to tick several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed . &quot;
some scripts allow setting up your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click Setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears on the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . then , select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please see section writing scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide should show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in order to understand the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that if you re @-@ coding to MP3 you will get a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide should show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD into just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;

the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules do not find . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and learn news from the forums . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatic &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for fired audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ co@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoding module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full @-@ featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can cause the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
&quot; saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog saves under which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file saving .
&quot; closes the current project . when a project has been changed and not saved yet , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can stop the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not saved , just as if you had called for each project file . &quot;
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called a file .
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to run the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here , you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by what is the ? remedy ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you get files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you to see files and folders already existing on the media .
&quot; this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD that you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD that you can then burn later on . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to format a DVD . using this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely delete the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then immediately be burned by pressing the B@@ race button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a pre @-@ created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously util@@ ised DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and trimm@@ ing black borders . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes the properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , the key assignment can be adapted to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and to fine @-@ tune the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications too , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive , which of the accompanying programs will give you the default . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can generate a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , quite simply audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard drive ) and from many enco@@ ders who encoding these WAV files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the songs of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you have to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pr@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the step @-@ by @-@ step example , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB requests the CD data according to the creation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding .
&quot; open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with another enco@@ der can be read as the default . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of messages ( such as logs , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main direction dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here , you must go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + High to very high audio quality ( with high bit rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music .
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo equipment with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo equipment with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression ratio around 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo equipment with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11.@@ 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stereo equipment . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / needed with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example for the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title Paramet@@ ers of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button description in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs so that everyone else can download this information instead of entering the computer itself . it is to be noted that here is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from making any information from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( fake ) address than those used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution , if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; for saving the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the lin@@ ux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writes and readers on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read out . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine since it is regarded as non @-@ completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write privileges on it ( eg ; trying to copy something inside with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what should be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; repeat .
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are lazy we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change them at any read of a &amp; CD ; if the appropriate settings are found once . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this is not working or if there is more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , it helps to view the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be as loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , select , so that you will be informed when information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b local in offline mode if you download the database beforehand . however , it is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worth it . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . &quot;
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request and for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the internet . how does the system know which data should get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as pictured in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server nearby .
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with protocol 80 , since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
&quot; number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded at the same time : with a dual @-@ core or qu@@ ad or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on disk runs . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was written in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; repeat . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; collect data manually instead of repe@@ ating them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet been done , the &amp; CD must now be pushed into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , search for help in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers , or go back to the previous section on the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD is successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that best fits your opinion to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic request of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; field . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data like in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t know the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are under rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the field of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked will be read out . a simple click on the line will turn off the selection of the piece , or press the button All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the button selection to read the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to turn on the job window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is being read straight to the hard drive . the status of the program is shown in the bottom left of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; assignment # 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format . thus , reading and coding are parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( though two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you are reading this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
this section is aimed at people compiled from source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step @-@ by @-@ step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program starts ) , or from an unusually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . if you want to add or change something useful , it is only after cont@@ acting the author . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ O and Kara@@ oke player by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also has some properties that other &amp; UNIX , MIDI players don &apos;t have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting . &quot;

please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in multiple pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid plays a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the template and so change the playing speed . in order to get the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no one is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have any lyrics : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically calculated , which uses a song so that you do not have to manually set up the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played after the series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the respective object in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when it is opened ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when adding Automati@@ cally to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song button , next song next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the Pre@@ vious item , the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but this does not matter , as it is not saved when you leave &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as requested . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you can see that Def@@ ine is needed to show that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be provided for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
in this section you will see how general MIDI pat@@ ches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , you can use the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that the term &quot; &quot; drum @-@ patch &quot; &quot; is the patch , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as are its presence . so , you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
&quot; key maps are mainly used to map notes on the percussion channel . for example , take a look at the provided Key@@ maps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , just do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; this is the channel which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . the corresponding key@@ map must , of course , continue to be defined in the file ! if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , you will always try to change the patch on this channel . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch bench@@ marks are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch gauge event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which is supposed to play pitch bench@@ marks with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play a bit higher up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; go around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . in the Settings menu , see Settings , point MIDI Settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played notes . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point Channel view : settings &quot;
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , etc . , so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files individually . &quot;
&quot; just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; in the first place , enable automatic Add to Collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or go ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) just in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch automatic Add to collection , and the new one ; File will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Add to collection and open up .@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have a lot of spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take MIDI files , make music and prove sentences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with me ( if you want to ) . but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me since I might already have the file . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I want to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or just a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also goes to all these excellent musicians on the web who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; additionally to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE site for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click a record , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you must select the play@@ lists from the menu and select either the Edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost when you leave the Edit mode , or select another group without the same playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ver@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation when starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would interfere with the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in@@ g &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / ; / / / / / / / / ; / / ; / / ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ;
there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output from mp@@ layer .
&quot; there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ e@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even em@@ bed the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . the gest@@ ed process is called cre@@ pp@@ layer . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end issue is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to always use a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; before being st@@ owed , the scanner must be configured from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video data Rec@@ order ) Settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there should be detected ports ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the video for@@ lin@@ ux is only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must include the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ ault , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , ver@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . if enabled , start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more quiet when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is the root user to execute on the device . it &apos;s absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine only starts slowly , so why does my CPU need to be tested for its performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ d. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will x@@ ine check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes a compilation of &amp; ki@@ le ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be applied to the package &amp; ly@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compilation and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users do not need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the box should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , or if you want to compile &amp; check , this should be addressed on the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn about its possibilities the manual of Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of Po@@ sters ; begin .

&quot; while here is only a good overview about &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; same as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Menu ) provides some options for creating the document . some can also be made to the document @-@ related settings .
&quot; document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; editor &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct &amp; lat@@ ex processing ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Article ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is only a brief description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source text editors - high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see greater areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical surroundings are not closed . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file . &quot;
&quot; with automatic loading of the surroundings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le , a blank line ( for example , \ \ end { command } ) is created and the added row for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows to divide the document into the following elements ( the highest and sub@@ paragraph is the lowest element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed with a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files . once a DVI file is created , jump &amp; box ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document , and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the usual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; if the search is used , the elements of the DVI ; file are kno@@ cked out with the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section is in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked , at the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer jumped . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is converted to &quot; &quot; un@@ der@@ unused &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the division are : &quot;
&quot; the remainder of the selection box is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , notes or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; description : with this command , a name is created for one section , one image or another element . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of selection field possible ) .
&quot; when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files corresponding editors are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; manually . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ø@@ e is used for determining the font size . it is possible to specify the font sizes for the main text , the notes etc . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ &apos; s command contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; execute the storage automatically .
&quot; if the document is not comp@@ iling , you should search for errors when logging in . when using quick construction , you should automatically start logging . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( environment ) is a text that is otherwise treated as the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size e 12 is created and only a few places should have a different font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will allow the change of the font size within the environment . &quot;
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or other environment . a single word in a proposition can be displayed in itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language was presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le will follow . &quot;
&quot; once the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do so , a quote , a few passages in the grease and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem should be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be converted back to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ app@@ . ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as Pr@@ inters , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed out ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preview search will allow the editor to jump directly from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this you just need to set up modern in settings box ... Tools build @-@ up .
&quot; to execute the preview search , the mouse po@@ inter must be placed in one line of the source code and cli@@ cked on the preview search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer is then performed . &quot;
with this function in &amp; O@@ cular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document von &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and spec@@ kl@@ ed to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; O@@ cular ; as text editor ( Settings ... Editor )
&quot; should an error occur , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file tells the source of the error in the source text . in the editor then the buttons La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ aked La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . to view the error line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the wrong line . &quot;
&quot; once the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard can be used for the quick creation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or create a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a new document using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings boxes ... Settings Gener@@ ally set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and the steps described under the steps described . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; posters ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and producing from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to find out more about the posters and its options , the book should be used for Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter work with the editor of Po@@ sters ; begin . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked over the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , and its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with C@@ tr@@ l key to select the tex word . this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with right mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with a rounded Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional jump stamps . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the additions to the St@@ eps or the respective button of the button allows the jump to the next or last jump brand . thereby , this jump brand is highlighted so that it is automatically displayed at the first input of a character . &quot;
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; posters ; already excellent possi@@ bil@@ ites have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
&quot; he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , this does not include a text with plain lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning closes with it tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also extends and lat@@ ex ; commands with a back@@ lash ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for learning a part of the document , it is possible to remove it first and remove it by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands here for faster possibility . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to Edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for additional commands under editing environment for possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will be ski@@ pped to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will be ski@@ pped to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can be quickly lost . this command completes the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups specified by brackets { ... } .
this command will be ski@@ pped to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
this command will be ski@@ pped to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly braces of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of ne@@ sted cur@@ ly braces , the overview can quickly be lost . this command completes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as a specification . for the purpose @-@ to @-@ use implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the character &quot; &quot; used for two simple quotes . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two closing quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings to@@ ggle ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there can also be other specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ di or French ) and thus German or French quotes . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when using Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
close the line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre@@ configured &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings to@@ ggle ; La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to er@@ ase this . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; add some space for the columns position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; posters ; already offering a good source of source code , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; these include special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work according to need and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different ways of working in settings boxes ... Complete . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ begin { Environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , as a result , the list can be enlarged . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump stamps can be added , so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible using the St@@ eps mark Next jump brand and the desired parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings to@@ ggle ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select various exec@@ utable lists for &amp; tex , - and lat@@ ex ; commands as well as rum@@ ors of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for completing environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call to full@@ fill mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full@@ fill mode over the menu item Modi@@ fied environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment automatically finds and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the surrounding conversion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a mailing list , a first \ \ item command will be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings to@@ ggle ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of exec@@ uting mode for tex &amp; tex , - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sion@@ nen . as an example of a query list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L has been entered and the word Termin@@ ation mode is introduced over the menu Ver@@ sion@@ Last Mi@@ ce or C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large e Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many more than once are written in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written exec@@ utes . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the menu settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ fully be@@ vel@@ ed . here you can also set the threshold for displaying the completion .
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / chest / ch@@ le / complete / mode / full@@ file home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the Graphics dialog allows to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to view the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ wise in the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and be viewed using alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick construction command , a viewer is usually called after the compilation . if no viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
&quot; a new project is about the project &quot; &quot; New Project .... &quot; &quot; by asking for the following information for the project : &quot;
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the &amp; Ki@@ le script function ; allows to execute the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet finished yet , and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for the packages contained and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application Tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the documents and for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the major advantage is the search for package names or pun@@ ches . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ led and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed . &quot;
many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we can use all under observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU ; license . current information about the contribut@@ ors is available in the menu Help on &amp; Ki@@ le ; .

&amp; C@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . signatures can be edited in the graphic user interface of &amp; k@@ sig . with the command line interface you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail applications like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you an empty signature ; in the signature section . click on the &amp; lt ; blank signature ; and paste in the bottom section your new signature . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail applications like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

clicking on an entity in the displayed list moves the text po@@ inter in the main window at the beginning of the appropriate file .
&quot; press the respective button ... to select the file you want . please note that the X@@ SL ; source code and XML ; data also can contain a UR@@ I with ht@@ t@@ p : / / , ft@@ p : / / or file : / / . the output file must be a writ@@ able local file . &quot;
to continue with the examples please select the following files in the example folder ; K@@ DE PRE@@ FI@@ X@@ gt ; / share / apps / k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g
you can &apos;t choose one or more settings from the Settings dialog . each setting is supported by a help window over the effect .
you can add no or more parameters using the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt parameter section of the dialog . this allows the transfer of parameter values to the style sheet .
&quot; in order to apply the changes made , press the O@@ k button . &quot;
&quot; the dialog box can be closed by pressing X in the top right corner of the window . if the settings are changed , open the dialog again . &quot;
&quot; once the style template has started , it can be used in the Menu Deb@@ ug@@ gle In@@ spi@@ rant ... then click on the tab holding points , as in the example below . &quot;
a file name can be an absolute path to a local file . or only the file name ( eg ; x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l ) .
&quot; a template or model name can be a fully qualified name , where the non @-@ local part is optional , e.g. x@@ s@@ l : my@@ template is also known by my@@ template &quot;
&quot; first click the stopping point in the list of the current holding points , then press the Rem@@ ove button . &quot;
&quot; the status of a specific holding point is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color . the desired color can be selected : see in the Edit Account Settings dialog , on the Color page . &quot;
&quot; you can set , disable or delete a holding point by pressing the buttons , the Deb@@ u@@ g menu or the icons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
most of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; will be captured and shown either in an In@@ spi@@ rant ... Di@@ alogue or in &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; -@@ output window . the following exceptions apply from this rule :
&quot; the different tools are available through the de@@ bu@@ gging menu , where the spi@@ der tool is most important . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on step @-@ by @-@ step execution in the menu , a dialog for the selection of the speed is displayed . &quot;
&quot; to stop the process , press the W button or select step @-@ by @-@ step execution in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to look up a system ID in the current &amp; XML ; catalog , select system ID ... in the menu and enter the value to be searched in the dialog displayed . &quot;
&quot; to hit a Pub@@ lic@@ ID , select Pub@@ lic@@ ID ... from the menu and enter the value to be searched in the dialog displayed . &quot;
&quot; if the In@@ sp@@ ection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ g In@@ spi@@ racy ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the tab Source text in the dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; -@@ source files included with the &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
selecting a source entry in the displayed list puts the text po@@ inter in the main window at the beginning of the appropriate file .
&quot; if the In@@ sp@@ ection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ g In@@ spi@@ racy ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the tab Source text in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; all found templates are listed here . note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; apply . therefore , multiple templates may be present with the same matches and mode details . &quot;
clicking a template entry in the displayed list moves the text po@@ inter in the main window to the corresponding row of this file .
&quot; local and global variables are shown on a map in the dialog X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g inspec@@ tor . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code , in which a global and a local variable is declared &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a specific expression , for example &quot;
&quot; contains , then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the text po@@ inter will be moved to the corresponding line of this file in the main window . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their inclusion in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as support . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my opinion and how outstanding it is . if we still need a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the required work@@ folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder field . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , anyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the file is just opened inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , select the current folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then you simply drop the current file . if not , delete the file in current file and select the file to be checked by using a different file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Ch@@ ecker option . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is required in file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , be selected , then simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in its home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and don &apos;t have to wait until someone uses it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ part , we begin with the menu plugin editing . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several persons work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking at the team member from the list and pressing the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : it can be an event for inform@@ ing the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event promotions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later on how much someone was working or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that a file is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
to enter notes is simple . either the note entry from the Editor context menu is chosen or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment field followed by comment text .
&quot; comments can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) , where nick@@ name is the team member &apos;s nick@@ name , is part of the project . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles are invalid regardless of upper or lower case but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the names : make the remark invalid .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting up Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified there@@ with . the entries are :
&quot; high / lower case of tags : great / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower case , tags are inserted as described in the tag XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower case , attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically include optional tags : when checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
do not automatically include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; update start and end date automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of accent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the appropriate coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e types for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
&quot; standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting here will be em@@ itted from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . however , this setting is destroyed by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ p layout command line parameters .
the warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by non @-@ check warning messages .
&quot; the location for the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , representing the figure of the Par@@ ser No@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action caused by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins are K@@ part applications from third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load component in &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error search has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set , as is the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points are listed , with time numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is produced , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so normally it does not need to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gger session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . output of this request will be displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug has started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing the variables to be monitored and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution starts as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible if possible in functions and include files . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next one as if there is no current one .
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adjust to your needs and how you can help you get better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / or CSS ; s consist of two file types , tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contains two file types , the text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alo@@ ges ; for the tag . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without a risk of a typing error .
&quot; tag folder is nothing but folder . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as a single element type over itself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used it is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed , etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editing dialog and the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but be aware of &amp; &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check tag X@@ ML@@ . to select . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently the check is only done when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not stated the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut , assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ script t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way to find the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PAT@@ H There is other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the current document URL . in the case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs the text becomes unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods above , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be used ; in the input field input , you can specify what to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected portion of the document is sent to the script . % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard output . it can be stated , what should happen to the text written to the default output , by setting the value of the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Day &quot; when available to allow input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size other . &quot;
&quot; please note that the icon created does not only help you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this icon will be a &amp; lt ; start@@ ing@@ ; tag in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the action you want . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar set dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the item which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by cutting all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; back in the right folder . after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user there is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like best . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; - Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , if anyone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / scrip@@ ting / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to that file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag 2.@@ html @-@ tag = tag 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ... &quot;
note the # prior to Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it for yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
space does not affect anything but note &amp; &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to design the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then , create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that they are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not get rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separated resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or anyone else . at different places , there is an Email Menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send the tool@@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . to make a contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can choose one . &quot;
&quot; upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , investig@@ ates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please read the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears indicating the author of the resource . &quot;
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; but it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files might be needed in the tag XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
Doc@@ type tag : the string representing in the ! Doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three sections : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in a global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use that user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are em@@ o@@ ded in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ des the common usage of special tools and samples from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Editor window , the construction plans , the boxes with information and tool@@ bars . please hit in , and for more information on these fields . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tab , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or exec@@ uting the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file when the string under the mouse po@@ inter is a file . &quot;
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste it into your document , then click on the icon representing the tag . now you can enter the data for this just added Tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the project views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with tab@@ s , files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation edi@@ ts are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , parts of the program , a whole website , etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the plus area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more to templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the information available to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens with reference to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears below the other tree views . with it , man@@ y@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window , can be accessed through the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool bar as compressed ts@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . to do this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed . &quot;
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H before its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to occupy themselves with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; however , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that , the appropriate &amp; IDE ; . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop , what has already evolved ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be almost any task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development , and has been quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , go to help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; converts special characters to &amp; HTML during inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ interpreted by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key .
this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
turning off and turning the problem @-@ porter at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you switch to the structural tree .
shows the symbol column to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries forecasts or next , depending on the cur@@ sors position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be set via settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are saved by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has done and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refresh@@ ed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ref@@ using by tool@@ bar , if this day in this place contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items shown above . click on it . click an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the posters ; version .
&quot; sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
&quot; checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D , using the external application ti@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes require time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . with a selection of one entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
depends on the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; posters ; find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add which and change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom , as e.g. after filling out the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the web@@ pr@@ j extension ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ht@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s see if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection of coup@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , cling out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window or Shift ; F@@ 7 key .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders available ) that will be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to select the de@@ bu@@ gger you want . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . you can find more information about G@@ ub@@ ed in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by creating a separate tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change , or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . currently , this behavior can not be influenced . &quot;
to open another project select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu of the right mouse button : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the upload files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on disk storage option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high load profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server where the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted from the View menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , ideally stack@@ able via the tool@@ bar menu . usage and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , the tool bar can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will also be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are basically like a standard file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , in about the limitations you set for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms mentioned at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary templates are usually found in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , note that ( although it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see in the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save Sel@@ ection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can use all file management functions for it , such as pulling and laying or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click a folder on the right and create a site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files , or link them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of container as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a sel@@ ector with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; if a root folder is set so , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ block . if nothing appears , you probably are in a root folder . &quot;
allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show the right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL editor and the second spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - Page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol displays the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ature of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; to edit this behavior , there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL editor and the cur@@ sor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL editor . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL editor and the source text editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; view , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that you want to change the title of the web page , so tools document properties are to be selected . this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL editor . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , for example , keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . clicking on the list allows you to change the content , e.g. keywords on the Name and Key@@ word keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible just like with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cur@@ sor is as usual in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted through typing and del@@ e@@ ased using button or remo@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor Tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other tag anchor tag . &quot;
some tool@@ bars like the table wizard or the Listen Wi@@ zard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of style sheets can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to be able to compile and execute successfully , except &amp; k@@ de ; libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already available with a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
3 way merging is also fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other one differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 -@@ o target folder C@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2
&quot; the Open dialog box allows you to manually type file names , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files . &quot;
&quot; by selecting folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merging of folders will be introduced . if for A file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merge is enabled , the input field will be active and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start merging / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what kind of thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you should first create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can easily copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : at the moment you can &apos;t extract and extract nothing . only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging of text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a little help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if both files differ , the default color for this is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merging ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the text output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; when you edited the result . typically , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary row in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first row of the group is displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area , and a black bar appears on the left . &quot;
&quot; sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging , or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merging conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting sources ignor@@ ing the options , Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , bottom , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ f as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the shared window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns , synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ in@@ wards ) or to the next / last un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . however , if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and eliminating manual copying . be careful with this option , as you may accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 doesn &apos;t keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when the file is finished and restored at the next start . ( menu settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in itali@@ c font are displayed . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered sc@@ aled . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , any selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is no longer necessary . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 attempts to find all the identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line delay &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only save a new@@ line character . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options will be handled in the chapter to scan folders and perform merge operations . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging .
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to quit and restart and restart to make the change active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries . &quot;
over the selection fields for the encoding appears a short notice of what the local code is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing instructions , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing instructions . &quot;
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ views . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of the three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just add the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes view the differences and then decide to merge the files . merge current file in the merge menu also works when you compare only two files . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this remote command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function e.g. to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this remote command . if a normal pre@@ processor command is also specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at the line balance . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program that themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ processor command for line ab@@ equ@@ als to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a binary expression that matches all characters in a row . the \ \ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword saved text $ . now the \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you &apos;re experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are lots of programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line devi@@ ce@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l only needs some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are retained for viewing and merging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks like .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line termin@@ ator will see the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; entire folder recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting
... can simulate the merge and displays the simulated changes without really performing them ;
&quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging separate files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folders , a small message window informs about the current progress . when you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and file that was found during the scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and the details pane to the selected object . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . at folders the age is irrelevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging does not begin . &quot;
&quot; a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging does not begin . &quot;
&quot; synchron@@ ize mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified , and if the option synchron@@ ize di@@ rs is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after merging &amp; k@@ rep@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is enabled , then investigate &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during merging , a file will be processed after the other . you status column displays skill if the merge has been successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is fine all over . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full @-@ time analysis , it will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the connection actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; note : if you do not have a destination folder , C will be used as the target in the three @-@ folder merge mode , B will be selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that may skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the menu -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to just select the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options Transpar@@ ency , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merging window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select restart / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog will appear . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can select another action for the entry , or solve the problem in any other way before proceeding with merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again when merging all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be viewed as done . only when you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 Settings ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . several patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders don &apos;t have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS too . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a prec@@ eeding dot sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; with links to folders : when the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively brow@@ sed . ( note that if the option is enabled , the links will lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the modification date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical when they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files are selected in such a way that they are both folders and the results from merging files are saved in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will also be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just merging whole folders . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible on the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the window divi@@ der to the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a single file directly , without having to start the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # speci@@ fies the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file will be a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select &quot; &quot; Pre@@ view &quot; &quot; in the context menu . in addition , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now called compact ) already exist . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or going to go this way .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ rep@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the case . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort was too great to date . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing the text , it is suddenly flus@@ hed ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis is conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from their colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later , to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diffusion a.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual working areas . it is pretty convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual working surfaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries tagged ... and ends . if however , on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and name of the application as well as entries minim@@ ise , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Be@@ end . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , window inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual working areas are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual working areas . if it is specified together with name , the names will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop will be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , all virtual work@@ tops appear in a horizontal row , which is very good for the display on the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , and then select switch settings ... allows the dialog to appear . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or assign to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers , and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start , a window appears as pictured above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag , displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , the area around the mouse po@@ inter is like a mo@@ ve@@ able magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can show a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the environment of the mouse po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse po@@ inter displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor settings . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; in the select window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can catch and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , if you press the Shift key or Shift + M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
stops or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your configured short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and com@@ min@@ ution , etc . &quot;
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visual handic@@ apped .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter persi@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is thought to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and each mouse click causes pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter persi@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires however a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the mere moving of the mouse . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement .
&quot; the smart shift activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this residence time must exp@@ ire after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; execute a mouse click .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent For@@ move is enabled , the shooting time is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this feature activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to reduce the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider Sound buffer , which you can set to lower value to shor@@ ten response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the Application button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last push of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off at first . if you are then used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a click of the mouse remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which is not a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually fairly simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when a move is started . if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you execute a mouse click yourself , so the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . but , park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy text , paste it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move , if you just start using the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select text as follows : press a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way , every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button p@@ ushes a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window will need to be installed . this should be the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&quot; this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome , and who are experiencing pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; K@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to speak their computers for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for itself . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , type the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . for more details , see the Description of the Direc@@ tion Di@@ alogue . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text directory . from the text passages you can choose often used text passages without having to type in . the text passages can , of course , be edited . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word supplement . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a running memory of the already mentioned sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have done k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is attached to the course memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ Apply as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , set the character encoding , with the text passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on to the voice generator unchanged . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples are given in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to add the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ale language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Vo@@ cabulary Book menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of the text passage , the selected text passage is directly spoken and added to the memory memory . when selecting the text in the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down box , closing the edit window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book with the selection of text passages . if you select any changes , the text@@ book directory will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text directory should be saved . &quot;
&quot; the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select the language you want for this resource ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you add a new empty dictionary without entries . as &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions , such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with references about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the voice output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . then the voice output command is : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without any restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ eb@@ . the voice output is then possible with one of the three command sequences : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option data must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax doesn &apos;t like to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp /
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be turned on as default input .
the language edition dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; as the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can send text through the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which the user can always re@@ write . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the machine .
&quot; for more detailed user documentation , help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus interface .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capability . &quot;
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; posters ; even if &amp; posters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
&quot; speech output is performed via the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language expendi@@ tures on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set up kt@@ ts@@ d over t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; posters ; with which a text file can be read whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) take place discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ spell mailing list . subscribe to the list above ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acces@@ . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and set the program speech utility . see also &quot;
&quot; the card speaker is displayed on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card is displayed in general . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to a number of printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card leader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the top speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list will also determine their priority . &quot;
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost always use . go back to the card general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text jobs . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language output system of &amp; k@@ de . click on the General tab General to open this card . here , you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card orders will be displayed , and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the mark , will keep K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS System by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if t@@ t@@ m@@ gr is terminated , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field &apos;s voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text jobs . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board pre@@ fix or open a text file to read it . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text you want to read , and select the main menu Tool@@ Text . after a short time the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ he@@ aders and other invisible brands will be read as well . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Tag ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text you want to read , and select the text to read in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; posters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts ; &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which belongs to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that K@@ Mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the program speech dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to choose a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working methods of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the continued orders will resume . &quot;
warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
&quot; news has the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone welcoming the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text jobs . any order you want from the card order is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a application that uses text jobs . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four job types are processed in queu@@ es except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reading , this output is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to screen re@@ a@@ ers output . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages , and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
&quot; filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be even more types of filters . &quot;
&quot; string plac@@ ements replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined canvas inser@@ tion filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way . &quot;
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ml .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be processed by all activated filters placed on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for setting string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the respective replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is only used when the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key when you click . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , q@@ d@@ bus ; the application id Cop@@ y @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only type copies . &quot;
&quot; if all the input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the character set filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs Edit or Edit as a Help for assembling these expressions . &quot;
&quot; X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can specify for example that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is handed over to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that the program sends , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the features of the speaker installed on the card card . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click it with a click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected who meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialogue box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the voice selection filter will only be applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS @-@ capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; see the full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; k@@ de ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text to read and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . specify for a list of all commands .
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then dict@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers mentioned supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors during the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ed . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are any problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a character set filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you will find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ d.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / k@@ de@@ d.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de directory . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS works with every speech synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and expand for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , source code for k@@ de@@ gne@@ .com or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check , if speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it uses the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , so the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the setup of speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required . &quot;
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can leave sentence or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender female , it is used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker chooses , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add to Add a speaker in the list or click Edit , the card speaker device will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Inter@@ active is shown below . for details on the modules you will find below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text handed over to festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls , you can adjust the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice selected by you does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply to click ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed on the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the section of the system to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed to or withdraw from the order shown in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed here . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or downloaded without support for the corresponding audio module ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % equivalent to half and 200@@ .00 ; % for example the double normal speaking speed . to enable these settings to be implemented the program so@@ x must be installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works for you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs . after the issue of Screen Reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning continues the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and screen re@@ a@@ ders , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the map noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and des@@ kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played are marked by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends if someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;

&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ free ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limits detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this allows you to start or skip or stop orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ limit recognition filter will be set up as default . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; in the simplest way , you will learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting . turn on the speaker selection and select text to read . switch on the speaker selection , change some features , and check how the speaker selection changes . you must of course have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long &quot;
&quot; then , if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function , you can pause and stop orders on the map card . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set @-@ limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; set text recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation , and insert a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , warnings , messages or the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter by mistake , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection &quot; &quot; you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of an equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best meets the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot;
&quot; select this check box , if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is , if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that placed in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the speaker field , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker select button and then use on the speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and kt@@ ts ; has been shut down . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall Street Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the console ; a message appears that says : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; I invited an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but respect@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio , there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed even on the card for speakers . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read it . ( this is because HTML is converted into SS@@ ml . ) Dis@@ able either the filter for converting HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t make it possible for websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . in order for the festival to produce no errors , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ml to S@@ aber replaces the GEN@@ DER tags . same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags as well . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own drawing chain filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer sub@@ stit@@ uting or going back . on the tab orders are displayed , the order consists of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead use a filter for set @-@ limit recognition instead . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts during audio output . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; freezes when you start a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;

&quot; before you use the synthes@@ izer , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help is found in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to pre @-@ read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice requires festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) code , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Synthes@@ izer ; then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
&quot; note that MB@@ RO@@ LA is not a complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates these by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German text di@@ phone . for more information , see . &quot;
&quot; with this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code to festival is added to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file , but in the festival / li@@ b / . instructions &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival from
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , inser@@ ting the error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ered speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console , on the command line . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows managing network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed for installing and installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option &quot; &quot; Network Settings &quot; &quot; is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network setup , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which matches the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by checking the setting of non @-@ recurring requests , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three Reiter : &quot;
&quot; the network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the network interfaces tab , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... to set up the device in the dialog .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the network , you can determine if the address you want is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching on a switched off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
sets the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
&quot; a host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ain@@ .@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator is part of the name resolution operator &apos;s name resolution . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit Pan@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the list Nam@@ ingly known hosts file name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of publicly known hosts includes some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still existing version of IP is to replace version 4 in future . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press the Add button repeatedly and enter the other alias names . &quot;
&quot; select an entry of a particular known machine from the list , and select Edit .... The dialog to edit the computer will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command needs to be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other applications . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended to only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , and in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; variable configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be convey@@ ed .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is attributable to . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work place , the network administrator is the contact person who uses a valid IP address or , if available , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the internet , so any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be made possible by setting a gateway . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a separate lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically modified for DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is another content to be found in the event of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config and another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; the default folder appears ; print dialog . if you choose to fold out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time schedules of users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard &amp; UNIX commands to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second objective was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dat ; re@@ members the tape back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the tape does not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ st@@ ressing , it searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the belt index should be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by folding the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; speci@@ fies through a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
&quot; before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not conform to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this will happen before you can format the tape before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require a format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the tape name and capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a check box . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the File menu ...
&quot; once the backup has started , the dialog box opens . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
&quot; once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog displays settings for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the review process and the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can re @-@ establish the restore , you must select the files to be recovered . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the File ....
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog displays settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialogue will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process , the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of tape :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings is created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work@@ folder .
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system are stored as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be listed separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape drive .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the instruction mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected ; do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to provide &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band id will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar @-@ versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a tape . this icon is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some advanced functions , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . among other things , this includes : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens itself instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely don &apos;t have permission to read in / var / log , for the normal user usually don &apos;t have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteria or string . to do so , enter a string in the filter bar . in the default setting , the selection field next to the filter will display the entry All . then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the name of a process , so show you and k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color as protocol lines of level indication . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off in the direction dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only a particular process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identi@@ fier ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you will be using the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system quickly becomes the standard for controlling program start @-@ ups when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . that &apos;s because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I won &apos;t go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level 3 is 3 . if you want to change that , then you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line like this :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to have a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start ( or stop ) it at this level .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ level@@ n or modify the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of available system services .
&quot; note : entries will be moved when you move them to a new realm . to only copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add them to the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; sometimes the sort number of an entry can not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the number numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore records thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the various work areas ( Avail@@ able System Services , Run@@ ning Level 1 Start , Run@@ ning 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as cur@@ sor keys to make a choice above or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by clicking the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly being re@@ started . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; in the LI@@ LO prompt , enter the lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ ning X , but they are not executed . &quot;
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and even if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ ning Level , so that they can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual adjustments . &quot;
the card password management option appears in case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD Unix .
this card appears only if space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( identi@@ fiable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ net on the file system ) .
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system , and the current file system is selected with space limitation using the field file system . &quot;
&quot; the card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ eric Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click on the Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boat manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
