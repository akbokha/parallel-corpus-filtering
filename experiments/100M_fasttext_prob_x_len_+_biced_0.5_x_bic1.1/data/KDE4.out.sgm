<seg id="3">"machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations do not make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated into the Babelfish website, where you can insert text directly."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available."</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">"to load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings Extensions.... Open the card tools and select the modules you want."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default configuration modules from the box kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>

<seg id="11">The module Receiving Filter (also called Folder Filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras ConView Filter. you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">"to use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools to view DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-Maps grants the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for & FSView; the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the hierarchy hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you can be considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area of child rectangles shall be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the inscription in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for Treemaps for Treemaps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained. frames are drawn to indicate the nesting of entries, and that frame will need space that is not available to the subordinate entries."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how partitioning the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, the implementation is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for labeling and avoiding space losses through frames so that rectangles arise that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View Angled on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>
<seg id="22">"originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for KCachegrind application."</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & edit; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you first start, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will also use as an Albenlibrary."</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a collection of images on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images, as a base folder. & digikam; view every subfolder as an album. no picture will be modified."</seg>
<seg id="68">"& digikam; thirsts recursively the library path in its full depth. you can't exclude subfolders, unless it is in hidden folder. this lets you insert a point in front of the subfolder's name."</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not take pictures as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera; then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keyword List to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, you may also be able to handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Centre support menu."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & digipe. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="74">"modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is then used as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232)."</seg>
<seg id="75">"digital cameras, which supports a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras, also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support, so that the preview images of digiKam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about & digitized; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam, by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; remove or change in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"moving and dropping images works everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that you can't put an image in keywords, data list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view. so the filter on the filename will only work if this ind's icon view is also displayed. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Albenign.</seg>
<seg id="85">"view & quot; My Albenlivequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos, which are stored by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date on which the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also copy or copy multiple photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the contextual menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you will be used to sort your photos after collection. if you want to add or delete new collections by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">"the album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums, sort by date."</seg>
<seg id="91">"buttons Elders, Mean, New: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteeper. this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">Album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window provides you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album the first time, you need to wait for a short while while the thumbnail images are generated. this can be avoided by reproducing all preview images in the Extras menu."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information on each image will be displayed below the associated preview. what information these are, you can edit via Settings; set up. select the Albums tab here and adjust the area preview images to your wishes."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the key words of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">"photos are all about digitized; go. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing displays your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to these. you can choose from the view of the images, a slide show or the editing of the images."</seg>

<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">"we also recommend to save the metadata option in the file's settings page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data will be added to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album Menu."</seg>

<seg id="157">"of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos when working."</seg>

<seg id="190">The most common protection against blackheads is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is normally available in the form of a plug-in bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">"if you are looking for an overvoltage protection, make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>
<seg id="192">"since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should pay attention to the fact that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage spouts which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card."</seg>
<seg id="193">"if you have a laptop, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a multitude of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem."</seg>
<seg id="194">"while an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an uninterrupted power supply."</seg>
<seg id="195">"in addition to the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="196">"consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in electricity disruptions with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & Euro; 40. this is only a small price difference when you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember to trash all cables before going on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="197">"the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can include it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software."</seg>

<seg id="199">"the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution."</seg>
<seg id="200">"Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online."</seg>

<seg id="202">"the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are vulnerable to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs, at least, provide the data integrity between operating system and hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="203">"the worst thing about it is that no one is telling you when a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you have one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer."</seg>
<seg id="204">"unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed."</seg>
<seg id="205">"even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year."</seg>
<seg id="206">"ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle sheet errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English."</seg>

<seg id="211">"journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost."</seg>
<seg id="212">"viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss."</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>

<seg id="219">"there is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for data loss despite fuse is panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day."</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to backup. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which one such backup has been made. this backup comes next with the exception that is only sampled and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>

<seg id="228">"as the future is unpredictable based on your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to forge a certain vigilance. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future."</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have entered the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk:</seg>

<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it anymore."</seg>
<seg id="238">"it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exit and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relatively many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (delate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. a problem is however that this format is adapted by many people. there are therefore over 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed due to the need to unify the camera body formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing DNG and we hope to use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block; technology of the '90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. the file information is saved with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP adapts because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models.

<seg id="261">"the file names are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can cause double file names, if you upload photos of different recording series to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made into the file name."</seg>

<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, compare, Automatically adjust and contrast from the menu Correcting Automatic correction try to make the best out of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scaled the distortion values across the entire image, so the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the intensity factor in the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a re-jiving of all values in between. this is only visible in the images, and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is a bit limited because it is possible to work over a color space with 8 bits per color. so if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochronym. you start it using the menu entry color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be customized in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original image again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The target image preview has a red marker. the pixel luminance below this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful here, even in well lit images, most pixels are displayed very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you enhance or even dim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above-mentioned controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if over a color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this will be displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file, and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button reverts all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. in doing so, also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. tint mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to adjust your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the tool color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, it was called" "Solarisation", "also called Sabatier, an effect that was created by inverting a partially developed print with a short flash light and then inverted the development of the image. the result was that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">"intensity controls solar activity. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>

<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and hot.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>

<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the Ok button and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>

<seg id="479">"& digikam, provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas."</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpness is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact it sharpens no bit; it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright of Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process colors must be combined with minimal differences to a color point. this in turn leads to blurred edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots on paper are printed. SLR cameras normally require more sharpness than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners alter a field of sharpness already during the image reading. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry to access Correct Doing."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should be careful because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will refocus. you will find further more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus on."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to make the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Correcise softeners and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right-hand side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the picture. the preview window displays the filter's output with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried out. an increase in radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats will produce close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image one that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus, one can define a minimal difference thus for an edge of the filter applied. thus, areas with a soft change between shades are excluded from sharper and therefore avoid beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocusing a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected drafting-filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to focus an image & quot; refocusing quot; in which it reverses the defocus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filming. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocusing results usually achieve better results than blurring in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding is much better than the auss's folding. the Gauß 'folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical results also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpening: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality will be very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further devise the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss'sche sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness gauge is sch. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, an increase in matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpening or the gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to do all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"in general, sharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurring of masking a larger neighborhood as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, unsharp masks always have to create artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter, it is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of correction correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob regulates the blurring of the area that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"if you want a blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools for removing unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the Rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed erect p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions smoothing and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpening should be subsequently subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smooths evenly in all directions while a value is smoothed near to 1. if you have a film graft or CCD noise, a high value will create wave-like patterns. JPEG's artifacts are best removed with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above ally. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore, set this value to match the degree of intoxication in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is traversed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-step length [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Knuckles Save as and Load do exactly this. correcting any image errors can be saved in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">"below you can see how image errors with small artefacts are corrected. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a strange black artifact created in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a proprietary algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blur the image."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value controls the pixel spacing. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maxim, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process of the image controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the image controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically stronger. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the alignment of phase jitter absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the luminance. when it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters of the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than to sharpen a picture. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Correcise softeners and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>

<seg id="567">"wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, & quot; vignettieren- quot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed in such circumstances that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should, even with center filters, use an aperture of f / 16 or less, since otherwise blurring effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the wide exposure of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter using an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker's copyright."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controls, you can control the Vignetting Correction filter and with three more exposure to the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density. the standard density is 2,0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2,. increase density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"pixel Strength, Contrast, and Gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options."</seg>

<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third grade has a similar circular effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the coefficient of 4 digits corrects the distant corners towards that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the strength of the second degree of distortion. with negative values, sound-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the opposite character of the parameter General."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resets the image size and causes a correction for the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Clear: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the Preview dialog shows the distortion parameter. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the tonne or cushion distortion should be performed before all trimming or resizing changes. the best way to perform this correction is to perform this correction first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonne-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the groove."</seg>

<seg id="593">"since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top conductors.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digitised; Filter Film Receiving is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film-grained effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special gallery-like, street-photographic, grained sight especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="601">"there are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large images. smoothing checks the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editor is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen yourself to sketch out. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>

<seg id="854">"the conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: do not expect it to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes, you get better results with dcraw!"</seg>
<seg id="855">"first, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option is whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later on."</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch doesn't have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you intend to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise use it later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality gets worse. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. so use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite existing file. however, this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed."</seg>

<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. there are four types of image change available:</seg>
<seg id="868">"proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="869">"proportionally (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen size."</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">"prepress: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas contents, layout and finish. in the following, each area is described more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next choose whether a & kphotoalbum is to be created; export file is to be created on the overview page. find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"on the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images, so those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not download any more pictures, such as a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"for all your HTML files, select a base folder and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first, you will need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"after you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all visible to the viewer. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>

<seg id="930">"the adjustment possibilities described above have moved all three to base folders and URLs. in them, a subfolder will be created, whose name you can set in the output folder."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to share your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time to fill in the picture information, people on the pictures, recording location etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not go again."</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file, or whether in the file is only a link to images. the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file is so independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kin file either directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kin file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches out the images that are in the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described which you can view via the File Export menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available for you:</seg>
<seg id="938">"if you want to copy manually to the .kim file, you need to copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim -files are normal zip files. since most pictures were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so please simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kin file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="943">"the wizard will consist of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the importing images should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you select the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported, and which categories will correspond in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>
<seg id="947">"in this manual, you will go through the different steps of (1) Set the information about your images, over (2) the browsing and view, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options."</seg>

<seg id="949">"photoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want."</seg>

<seg id="957">"photoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves."</seg>
<seg id="959">"since the modules of several applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures. demo database can be either accessed via the command line using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I would not have warned you!"</seg>
<seg id="960">"the applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, making it possible for some modules to work with & kphotoalbum; this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications using KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum."</seg>
<seg id="962">"simulate & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="963">"besides the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to deliver a list of albums. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="964">"if & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module."</seg>
<seg id="965">"or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum will do so, so if you have selected people to view and pass on to the module."</seg>
<seg id="966">"since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and choose the modules to load modules."</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">"as you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top of the toolbar. at the moment, there is not much information, as you do not yet have information about your pictures."</seg>
<seg id="969">"one of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate any image with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image has been recorded etc. you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen."</seg>
<seg id="970">"all these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer."</seg>
<seg id="971">"these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum, since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and the same 5-10 persons are mapped on all 50 images, you can find that the names used are moved up to find people faster and assign them."</seg>
<seg id="973">"if you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date on the list."</seg>
<seg id="974">"if you have selected notes for each image, you may want to edit all selected images and annotate these images with annotations. in this case, just click on the above and back buttons that are located at the top right of the picture."</seg>
<seg id="975">"if you have added several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally images with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling involves the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is repeatable depending on the calculated colour values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 then 5x5 (25) will be charged extra pixels per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you turn on jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step as you should have understood the basic approach of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">"in view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the application button), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you moved the ground around one unit downwards."</seg>
<seg id="1104">"of course, the rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, set a suitable material."</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo equipment with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo equipment with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio around 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo equipment with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11.128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and auto-stereo equipment. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / needed with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example for the & CD; add titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title Parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button description in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs so that everyone else can download this information instead of entering the computer itself. it is to be noted that here is only spoken by text: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from making any information from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (fake) address than those used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution, if this has not yet been done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined encoders. more information about encoders is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writes and readers on it and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with one step for example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; read out. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine since it is regarded as non-completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write privileges on it (eg; trying to copy something inside with the conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">"the first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator;, something that is probably done only once and"</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what should be repeated for each reading & CD; repeat.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy we share the program to use the freedb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change them at any read of a & CD; if the appropriate settings are found once."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"often, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk. if this is not working or if there is more than one & CD; / DVD drive, it helps to view the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be as loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"only in case of incomplete information, select, so that you will be informed when information on the creation of keywords (tags) is missing."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"the second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with konqueror- &gt; renamed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"you can work with freedb local in offline mode if you download the database beforehand. however, it is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worth it. to use freedb in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first."</seg>

<seg id="1587">"attention: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data like in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed."</seg>

<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">"if you have more than one collection, you can set the respective object in the collection manager."</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">"when you leave the application, this collection will not be saved."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"to add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"when automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when it is opened (using File Open or Drag & Drop)."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"when adding Automatically to the collection, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when a piece is opened. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"to remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"you can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection."</seg>
<seg id="1646">"if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined."</seg>
<seg id="1647">"to play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text."</seg>

<seg id="1650">"to delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"the temporary collection cannot be deleted, but this does not matter, as it is not saved when you leave & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you have only one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as requested. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap"... END Define keymap "Another keymap..." END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that Define is needed to show that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be provided for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how general MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, you can use the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that the term" "drum-patch" "is the patch, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as are its presence. so, you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"key maps are mainly used to map notes on the percussion channel. for example, take a look at the provided Keymaps."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, just do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is the channel which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. the corresponding keymap must, of course, continue to be defined in the file! if you use the ForcePatch option, you will always try to change the patch on this channel."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBender Ratio indicates in which ratio pitch benchmarks are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch gauge event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard, which is supposed to play pitch benchmarks with the value 4096, to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play a bit higher up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; go around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. in the Settings menu, see Settings, point MIDI Settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played notes. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point Channel view: settings"</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, etc., so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anybody, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example kmid; 's start page)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all the files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"in the first place, enable automatic Add to Collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I want to play a karaoke file) or go (if I want to play a karaoke file) just in the & konqueror; drag the window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;.</seg>
<seg id="1691">"if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, switch automatic Add to collection, and the new one; File will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically Add to collection and open up .mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user there is the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like best. that's why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; - Repository, if anyone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / scripting / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>

<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation such as:"</seg>

<seg id="2063">Note the # prior to Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space does not affect anything but note & & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & & & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to design the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of contextual elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then, create a folder (as you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that they are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not get rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & Quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the separated resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners, or anyone else. at different places, there is an Email Menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP), send the toolbar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & Quantaplus; users can download them. to make a contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can choose one."</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in a global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use that user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are emoded in the folder tree of the project, which emodes the common usage of special tools and samples from all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editor window, the construction plans, the boxes with information and toolbars. please hit in, and for more information on these fields."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tab, reloading, deleting or executing the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file when the string under the mouse pointer is a file."</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as default for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further extension of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; paste it into your document, then click on the icon representing the tag. now you can enter the data for this just added Tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog with different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the project views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to & Quantaplus; navigate, open and roam. in the presentation with tabs, files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation edits are available."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, parts of the program, a whole website, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the plus area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more to templates is available."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the information available to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens with reference to navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"this tree appears below the other tree views. with it, manyfast attributes and namespaces can change. the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site can be downloaded, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"by default, & quantaplus, two cartels at the bottom of the window, can be accessed through the useful information: the message window and the problem window."</seg>
<seg id="2100">"this tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensively extended and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the tool bar as compressed tsar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email they can save and load them in & quantaplus; like any other!</seg>
<seg id="2104">"it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. to do this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>

<seg id="2107">"during the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to occupy themselves with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"no longer restricted to pure & HTML; however, & quantaplus; well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then you should be & quantaplus; for that, the appropriate & IDE;."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time changed the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"so this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3, could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions were added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work, was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">3 way merging is also fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this feature."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are shown visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other one differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2-diff3 folder 2 -o target folder Cdiff3 Folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2</seg>
<seg id="2294">"the Open dialog box allows you to manually type file names, select the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"by selecting folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merging of folders will be introduced. if for A file is selected, for B and C, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merge is enabled, the input field will be active and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start merging / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what kind of thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you should first create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; then you can easily copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can't extract and extract nothing. only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging of text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a little help window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"if both files differ, the default color for this is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is activated, the line is dotted on broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the text output:, the filename and [change] when you edited the result. typically, it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary row in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first row of the group is displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area, and a black bar appears on the left."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging, or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a mark that you may copy and paste elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; merging conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: when selecting sources ignoring the options, Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, bottom, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Sif as you can also use it from other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the shared window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">"one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns, synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window)."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / last difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture Abinwards) or to the next / last unresolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the selection to the clipboard, you must copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). there is also the option selection automatically copy. however, if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. be careful with this option, as you may accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 doesn't keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should not use binaries."</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when the file is finished and restored at the next start. (menu settings &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">"choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)"</seg>
<seg id="2323">"if you activate this option, differences in italic font are displayed. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens."</seg>
<seg id="2324">"on systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered scaled."</seg>
<seg id="2325">"when this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"if you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"if this option is enabled, any selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. manual copy to the clipboard is no longer necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"when comparing files, & kdiff3 attempts to find all the identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) save a cart return character '\\ r' and a newline delay '\' at the end of a line, while others only save a newline character."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"in default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"in default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"search intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"in automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful when white characters are less important in many files. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu."</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options will be handled in the chapter to scan folders and perform merge operations. see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to quit and restart and restart to make the change active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">"the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries."</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for the encoding appears a short notice of what the local code is. (this can't be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">"adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define preprocessing instructions, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing instructions."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in the text or overviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded overview column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of the three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just add the less important windows. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes view the differences and then decide to merge the files. merge current file in the merge menu also works when you compare only two files. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)"</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this remote command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function e.g. to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this remote command. if a normal preprocessor command is also specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only at the line balance. you can write your own pre-processor, which corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program that themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessor command for line abequals to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\ 1 / 'This. * is a binary expression that matches all characters in a row. the\\ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword saved text $. now the\\ $\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you're experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are lots of programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line device. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed, you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl only needs some details. where used\\ (and\\) is needed, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor are retained for viewing and merging. the other operations only change the data that the newline algorythm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you use a normal pre-processor, the line terminator will see the output of the normal pre-processor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>
<seg id="2361">"often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; entire folder recursively."</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the suggestion before starting</seg>

<seg id="2958">I won't go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not below / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs from BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level 3 is 3. if you want to change that, then you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to have a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>

<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start (or stop) it at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or modify the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>

<seg id="2975">"sometimes the sort number of an entry can not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the number numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore records thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to activate the various work areas (Available System Services, Running Level 1 Start, Running 1 Stop & etc;) as well as cursor keys to make a choice above or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
