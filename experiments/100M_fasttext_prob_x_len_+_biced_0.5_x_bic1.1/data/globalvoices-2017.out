&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , have danced to American music , read American authors and run their sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magnet with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a law student . &quot;
I was trapped .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very playful love letter about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never holds behind the mountain , as one says so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in the Repub@@ lican front elections , was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , welcomes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s world@@ view agreed not with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ ump intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a great deal of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the presi@@ dency to a man despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters to be the ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people said one of my friends is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think differently in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , did they perhaps want to say that they are still important in America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
white and Whi@@ pl@@ ash ( white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ) ; the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash of white in allu@@ sions to white and whi@@ pl@@ ash as the big Van Jones described has exactly what America did so great .
&quot; millions of people around the world value the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man , whose story , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a vast portion of the white America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was pleased , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ ump &apos;s country , &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music , which is played in both places , not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students became the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs violence . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered youth a rare glimpse of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ mo@@ il you learn to play the trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located on the top of the largest garbage dump of Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - are based on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers began to turn parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ manufactured material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated in li@@ beri@@ as waters illegal fishing before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were upset by this and were little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were mobili@@ zing swiftly against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing license . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pil@@ la@@ ging the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had expelled from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing of ecos@@ ystems can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the s@@ nail &apos;s pace with which information is circul@@ ating between individual countries , the actions take place nowadays in real time , with trace@@ ability to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also atten@@ tively follows the activities of ships , when they move on the open sea via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships which fish in prohibited areas . even so suspi@@ cious cycling routes are discovered , such as those indic@@ ative of a ship loading their caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not financially viable . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which will lose eight members of H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network each year due to illegal fishing , which enter East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also un@@ even illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include campaigns such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , ph@@ antasi@@ en@@ ames , fish @-@ protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You should not run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; yet another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i tries to close . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fal@@ si@@ fied licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships using multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing across great distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track the illegal ships that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal f@@ ishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered from satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana sea protection organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of every single track@@ able ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to expect consequences , now know that they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets which were prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear from illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined forces , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also combat illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Safety is the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph . in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans really works across the ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of opposition to a referendum to im@@ pe@@ de , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country running into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des @-@ regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ facing Bun@@ de@@ staat Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is worsen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current president , Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate is one of the highest in the world ( inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine persi@@ sts , the referendum aimed at re@@ gaining its institutional structures and closing a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( roughly : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , continued to continue . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;

especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there the prot@@ esters reloc@@ ated to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not carry any skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the extent of suppression per day : &quot;
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial approval procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview given by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was originally published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities committed in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³r@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept family secrets for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and that before a Federal Constitutional Court pronounced against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there , I had friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
just point out that they don &apos;t de@@ duct you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Labor Party of Argentina . &quot;
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything was possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; this day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
over there the prisoners are tortured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a lying on which people were tortured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just lying there .
&quot; they seldom tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fying ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eyes . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; close to the entrance , people mun@@ ched quietly on their matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you think as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
&quot; Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was indic@@ ted by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of La Per@@ la Memorial Site , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you &apos;ll see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; their names were changed here , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order was removed from the top that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils &apos; of war
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was myself at the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military sign that one has fought against an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but when one walks into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a war yield , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
this was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we weren &apos;t poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ at@@ ant in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me a burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel regret . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you can see the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap your children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself again and again : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been possible to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
didn &apos;t these people also have families that were handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re @-@ established , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; but , of course , something remains . &quot;
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I bl@@ amed him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed anybody . &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they supposedly defended were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , let me tell you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I registered the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me for being bi@@ ased . I ended up saying against my own father .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 , before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age . &quot;

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the Jud@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 Inves@@ tig@@ ations were found guilty of crimes against humanity ; in 28 cases , the Court sentenced him to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison terms between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the 54 accused were killed during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ on Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he directed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for that took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be built there , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; terrible driving &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving licence . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
edit the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which the driver &apos;s license can be extended , witnessed a very un@@ successful translation last month . &quot;
&quot; in a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; the older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; was wrong@@ ly translated as &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; - perhaps even with malicious intent and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appeared in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the fla@@ wed English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of K@@ YO@@ TO exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the mistake had already been contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News talked about the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; has been denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is a matter of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 out of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has sun@@ k overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation error received among others the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How wrong is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so popular all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and use active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost genetics or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; however , some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English language is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the en@@ listed and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases , which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for a number of languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards you can expect more careful translations .
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source of translation . &quot;
Venezuela : protest and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers included recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was caught and recommended to use the U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ cens@@ orship : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; appeal to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I once again signed up with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ medi@@ at@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , has shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or refuses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : thus , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans are becoming increasingly difficult to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ t as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for many years .
&quot; today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ min@@ ta who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying Sk@@ ins , deca@@ ying Schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
&quot; shortly before she graduated from university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she , from which something has become , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ mean tas , in Paraguay there are more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money hands over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over his head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that children have to pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted . &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for several years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke to Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ min@@ ta is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they can conclude their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; is handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies the exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent sho@@ cks . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ min@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra proposed a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered le@@ thal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ mean az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be a landmark case - for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go was brought to trial . &quot;
the Every@@ day of a Cri@@ min@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers now had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ min@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked every day between four and six hours . &quot;
she had to divide the time in such a way that she had time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food either . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the house &apos;s library than food out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the master of the house forced Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition journals such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; the master had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would again learn &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; . &quot; this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would speak at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their masters feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , they explained . &quot;
&quot; however , she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ bbing and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ min@@ tas when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ tic . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay can be shared . &quot;

please contact us .
&quot; start from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the display received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland that wants to work . &quot;
then the author of the display switched itself once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; public domain , CC@@ 0 . &quot;
sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted to draft legislation on &quot; the regulation of use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; based on the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de Application &quot; which is run and used via the Internet to communicate with others through voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not give evidence on how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook , because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Lead Research Techni@@ cian &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to justice . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , maxim@@ izing the control and ensuring that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long sentence was intended for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kurdish natur@@ alist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original to En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the Kurdist@@ an Mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards who strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus SA sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Per@@ si@@ can Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and flour@@ ishing of the ecosystem also depends on a big predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wilderness is minimal and goes against zero . when the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which is not only composed of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who had been affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring settlements Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , already alone for this reason , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local perspective what progress has been made six years later to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures until December 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , six years after the catastrophe , they still endeav@@ oured to res@@ ett@@ le the evacu@@ ation of temporary shel@@ ters ( C@@ assi@@ ly , Kaz@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees , who were leaving behind the disaster , were transferred to final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 per cent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agr@@ arian country , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident moved extensively into the country . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land are located in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , lying in the &quot; nuclear explosion zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is still far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ated population . she asked them about the status of re@@ building and how their feeling has changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey reported that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot;
as to those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its commem@@ oration of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear disaster that Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in early 2016 , more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated camps are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people from other countries meet who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often sees that one more combines than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we cover topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has consolidated her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa recalls the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit . last Friday he was beaten by a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a head@@ stock . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march across the country .
&quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German university of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show police officers as he strikes at the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer were beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs hurry to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado recalls other attacks on violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;

police gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , polic@@ emen were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to renoun@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media squ@@ ander@@ ed street protests by directing the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paolo and Est@@ ado de S. Paolo specifically reported on a broken glass window , in order to design their titles illustr@@ atively with a photo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic background , more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing . &quot;
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; here , too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the For@@ bi@@ dden Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law by Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba included the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central in Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after planting , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory was gradually losing its facilities until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back in operation , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again around a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound is to remain , according to the 2016 published report &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ spec@@ tors &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the closure of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats the most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all those sur@@ vey@@ ed are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it dealt with officially auth@@ ored documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ se and the date . &quot;
&quot; they were all signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was passed and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation , &quot; he asser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important job generating sets have been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services they were generating in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted just high by grinding .

&quot; after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to medi@@ tate , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were replaced with spare parts .
&quot; without the prospect of the future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the provision of the congregation . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month , to spend the years retired in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a rep@@ utable person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ menting him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene walks in pension for 65 years , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter . &quot;

&quot; young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of traveling workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop means that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ ill@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of the street in Western Canada where almost two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
most of the cases have not been clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths did not always speak the languages of the First Nations lingu@@ istically . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation was recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; this way , they can grow and as well as our youth move forward &quot;
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( in order to meet the needs of the guests ) outside of a typical restaurant , Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; C@@ art models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or going on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ er district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets today . &quot;
&quot; with Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in the special sale : new mobile phones decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ated magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an Imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition .
and here is an apple holding your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the Com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phones and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ betra@@ yed is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also pad@@ dy balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon . &quot;
other bizarre plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver matt blog post . or follow Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 3 .
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the extre@@ mi@@ sts and comm@@ uni@@ sts regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this fight ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely displaced the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ pse , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; &quot; ap@@ ening a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; learning with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project :
organised crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ vi@@ que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves , to go and to search for tom@@ bs , to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he was supposed to be back , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta says : &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get it off because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ ri@@ a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gil@@ ity and the leadership of the state . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different to it or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants to be Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
for me this is as if they mo@@ ck@@ ish those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ action of human beings is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village would be justified by the fact that they were &quot; so@@ aked . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. , Mexico City , wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family is pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the blood of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence caused by the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the country &apos;s soul .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; ap@@ ers a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and the pages to which he links , include pictures depicting violence . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or , or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to capture trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices , or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample accurate coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people looking at the World Cup . &quot;
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to inno@@ c@@ ence .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident portra@@ y the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of char@@ red bodies , lined up on the floor while people look at them . &quot;
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years , the same photograph has been recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , particularly in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been cut , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated metap@@ hor@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; the occasion for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ ah and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo re @-@ emerged , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments , like this example , fal@@ sely affect the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could be beaten , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news site , fal@@ sely claiming in 2012 that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein has said that monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to capture this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source were also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein &apos;s statement but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the global coverage of false information
traces of these false statements extend up to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse search &quot; search , you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix of private sites , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , spor@@ adi@@ cally others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on the publication on which side they were published . thus , we want to show the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked together ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country studies of false coupl@@ ings of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit or fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also show fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only identifies the false report , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia provides two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the picture from the DR Congo , on the one hand , a tweet showing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand trying to legi@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya have been mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government has published a right to judge what it sees as &quot; deliberately exposed &quot; news and photos depicting international media , international human rights organizations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judge , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ es , who operate the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often propag@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted his 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , which has now been deleted , has explicitly stated that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was circul@@ ated later in connection with the massacre at B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo , fitted with this Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag , dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam in the name of Islam .
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ aned ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the Embassy in which the picture was contained in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ ancing themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) also points to Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and in some cases they have image file names linked to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original result of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and Pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames ( fra@@ me@@ works ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ der@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and does the actual horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent ima@@ gery has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images can des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologist experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , but what actually can be used detached from the context or in a totally ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( currently unclear ) makes an effort to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
&quot; such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , often very complex or specific . &quot;
&quot; some of these unmistak@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ sage ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ aker ) . &quot;
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are necessary in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Ra@@ ise your parents in recognition of how they endea@@ vor@@ ed to keep you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have been war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish even more of these &quot; &quot; conf@@ using &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ews the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country via the banks . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement from the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and circa 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water bo@@ oths of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood conditions .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods d@@ ashes the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for anyone who wants to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; if you need help in this field , please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 . &quot;
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre will be informed .
&quot; last year , after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood control &quot; &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eval of assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , brings people in need of security and provide emergency measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with Sri Lanka &apos;s population being ready for a long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot;

&quot; I confi@@ de in her my four years old daughter , she confi@@ des in her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we are still calling for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next one , we are chann@@ eling rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f high , tied out of an American flag , others are shou@@ ting slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ duc@@ ted me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we don &apos;t look all the same .
we practise our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that once Muslims , as I do not fit there , are ab@@ duc@@ ted . &quot;
ab@@ domin@@ als become lim@@ eli@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
&quot; this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day when he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western imagination , the Rum@@ is religion was er@@ ased , as did the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be rescu@@ ed .
the ground @-@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ buted history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand out even today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to stay . &quot;
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful and er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds .
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movement for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it cle@@ ars the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has so deep and fla@@ wed our collective imagination that Si@@ kh men and children often become targets of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims form the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother preferred her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan had re@@ thought the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were irre@@ fut@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa@@ h W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we do not wear all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widely spread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current tape of a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , has been manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger , who tear a woman &apos;s head . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the br@@ anding that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered her the Arabic verses to the protection , which seal the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim adher@@ ence is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging is the image of my grandmother , mat@@ ernal , with her sisters ; how they win a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi decades ago . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete pictures painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims consists of how they taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that - for centuries - was col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; Empire &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed by a company called Hon@@ worthy Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he could not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ alised &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history has been dis@@ car@@ ded over a century ago by a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ ical sub @-@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried beneath the rub@@ ble of war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is home to the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history four times more is reported than a story with a white assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call to prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that a two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country . &quot;

it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion houses more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble doub@@ ting &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people can build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ ars that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists of immigration officials , who take a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; that largely targeted Arabs and Muslims .
it is the wars that we are leading and the bombs that we throw away on Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the incorrect and dangerous pic@@ torial prints that we are ste@@ aming in our news editors .

&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I have been bombar@@ ded in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because he feeds on a new future in which we have no President , while he already bom@@ bed broken countries and &quot; &quot; other made &quot; &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
story@@ telling initiative wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a chance to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible response . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the multitude of languages of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
&quot; for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies : &quot;
&quot; the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure rooms , in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening &quot; is often associated with &quot; understanding &quot; these events instead , &quot; listening to appreci@@ ating , feeling , engaging . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and presentation lead to the audience &apos;s attention . &quot;
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ u tells the tale of the h@@ are and the vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his tale , John Ny@@ ug@@ u is asked : &quot; what about an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stories of history . &quot;
Puerto Rico claims to re @-@ establish sovereign debt by the US
&quot; with the aim of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which were up to 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march started at Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ana . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ uro @-@ testing of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishing debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remuneration that operates in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are ref@@ using to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the territory &apos;s integrated territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed from the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration was called &quot; Night Watch for Light and Truth . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual digital culture conference held in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publisher of book S@@ prints &apos; finished books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inves@@ tigation ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available license @-@ free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are set up and what are the real costs associated with this .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movement for free knowledge , have worked on site to look beyond the mist that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current status or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; seeing Bass@@ el paying a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , writer and attorney N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the Military Court . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Braun , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passed the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sel &apos;s cultural prototypes was more forward @-@ looking than the work , which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here , Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influence . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do all it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this move into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion , sharing his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
I spent my whole life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I &apos;m overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in custody . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought the Internet to me .
&quot; he also taught other deta@@ inees how they use computers , at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind at the moment in which we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the crow@@ ding of prison
and I &apos;ll enter every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion , &quot;
if your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and laugh and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s imprisonment , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bash@@ ar &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : director of corruption indic@@ ted after release on previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to corruption in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus , in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment on account of mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on 19th April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer back to his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call the action good . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary proceedings against the contrary .
&quot; however , the company apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been sent off . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid papers and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is willingly paid for his silence . &quot;
contrary to that !
&quot; Bit@@ on Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director had no moral : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks moral return and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man , who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , to remind him that a th@@ ief has been in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el &apos;s prison which will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of anything , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , an ambitious person is criminal . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ ins .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took up their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &#91; Bur@@ m@@ ese &#93; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ u@@ sive con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts in the purpose of their use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , a chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ shortage A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphasized that Facebook must be more analytical before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spac@@ ers ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who propag@@ ate hate speech , get a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cur@@ tail its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have proven that the cens@@ orship of bu@@ zz@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , using social networks simply to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts when he only wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail was not consistent with the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinion against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post office was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ins believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but so it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have prohibited such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; heredi@@ tary cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to rec@@ tify the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t include hate speech , but were nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat a pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to check if Facebook removed the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; if you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have been using social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also fuel violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where thousands of Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for failing to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country has unanim@@ ously adopted a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ able age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this amend@@ ment of the married couple , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 it came to a large public scre@@ am . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ 4@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere unless the age determines maturity . &quot;
&quot; regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married at 15 was in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements committed to abol@@ ishing the inf@@ ant &apos;s laws , followed at the foot , and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the to@@ e , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but early 2017 the bill was decided against the inf@@ ant before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would already make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child@@ birth was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided against it .
&quot; once approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of the child &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk which conce@@ als the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? child marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ oted @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot;
the law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ly Mut@@ ota , belonging to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
&quot; the draft on amend@@ ment of the spouse was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were opposed have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ marri@@ ages abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the general secretary of the San@@ atan har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj proc@@ la@@ ims his intention of taking legal action , should the law be passed and he seems to resolve his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wants to go against the law , most social media users would wish to tackle the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , &quot; &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the to@@ e is legal or the norm is still the norm although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ News to the local news service that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia articles again &quot;

&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series oppose the lock .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy internet users are used to using re@@ circulation tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain locked , several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) now appear . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid out all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , the content remains accessible despite legal prohibition . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff at mo@@ z@@ illa im Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server continues the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
&quot; a su@@ h@@ len@@ se rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him .
this motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar endeav@@ ours to bring Nepal an animal world to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that direct the attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class position helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I was just resting at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leop@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ el down pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he ought to know it , for he was already facing Tig@@ ers face to face , &quot;
a tiger can not interfere with the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately sits down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos to promote the protection of wild animals .
&quot; his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wild animals , however , is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce their hus@@ bands name for the first time . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a content sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , it is best to avoid women with the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband , and the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm to get this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a fake and viol@@ ated by her family and community after having addressed a married relative . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assignments to fear if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and dedicated to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages these clubs . &quot;
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in their discussion was women who did not name their hus@@ bands on their behalf .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women can easily identify with .
&quot; to speak out loud the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they have perpet@@ u@@ ated and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition att@@ ests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not think this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched that we never had thought about this round of discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home at home . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my wife @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she only ki@@ cked away during the whole exercise , another decided to release the whole issue of fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the rush of adren@@ aline to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed at her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that shows the sp@@ ouses : &quot;
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced red point if he would do it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
for many women the club club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip with every disc@@ us club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about many things , such as our identi@@ ties attached to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to tell certain things loud , no matter how small they happen to one . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ sa @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much quar@@ r@@ elling and discussion on the advantages of their own dress code , the moral associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
we have made only small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - lie at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we &apos;re doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Day commem@@ oration in Japan . for some 51 years , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;

the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
&quot; today , Beat@@ les Memorial Day is celebrated . &quot;
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , of course , Japanese will also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are the 5 places you absolutely need to visit . &quot;

good morning together .
&quot; today , Beat@@ les Memorial Day is celebrated . &quot;
&quot; right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
&quot; and of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market value , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could it be for a day ?

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .
&quot; photo : An@@ other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ trading , probably for dis@@ believers , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government has now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the bor@@ ough of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia declared the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the target of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that in the South African country the UN carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest mur@@ der@@ ings of three bald men based on their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power that generated riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog poor S@@ nai@@ ppa that indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
&quot; I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME fo@@ ams a country in which people would have shame to go to the streets , to demand sex against good marks , to demand decent work and other achievements , a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for dis@@ believers or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; are to be pursued which aim to achieve spiritual riches . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ted that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ faced : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : nine Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Dan@@ ger ) after participating in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to call on the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government shared that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . Norway signed an agreement only in June to resume the export of salmon to China as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to take his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China for the release of Li@@ u , as stated in a statement on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to abol@@ ish all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they are to meet and receive all visits that they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
the United States
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery .
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy calls on the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Embassy sum@@ mons a fur@@ ious reply from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with China that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife . &quot;

&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin believes that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; and that &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had major concerns whether the fuss surrounding Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada &gt; Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room at the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and release the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France : France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China in an Declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; while the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; the Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who are campaig@@ ning for peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in a statement on June 28th around Li@@ u and stated that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he told about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; personally , I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they were compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
it supports Singapore to be regarded as a city .
nobody asked whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , one hears that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the main point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re appears again from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the responses to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our political system , really non @-@ rep@@ lies . &quot;
he answered corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country is our city ? &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our not@@ e@@ worthy K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; while An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points out regarding the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said in Singapore ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , really associates himself and is aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review outlines the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , are we only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is both land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet &apos;s cabinet , statements by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not only defend their city ? &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore expands and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on which situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little difference between Canadi@@ ans and Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , for example , if you &apos;d confused me with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , to be called &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be pi@@ ous - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to pay no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major property of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau looks at the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ od@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video which perio@@ dicals the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continued to dominate the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Colour group describes a young man who tells the instructions of his girlfriend .
&quot; although not politically politically , the music video indirectly refers to the continued military su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves in the position of the country under the rule of jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; adjustment change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear requirements are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , which monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand is committed to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Viol@@ ence ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup in the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in Eastern Asia Minor

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only re@@ covers very slowly in East @-@ West @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an War was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ ai@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sig@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Central Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ k@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 since it has barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , some 43@@ ,000 people lived in this area . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ uk@@ w@@ ka , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deca@@ ying and very rare are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v &apos;s , which still house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where washing is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ ok@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in the winter , district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t have to leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will always stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
ante G@@ aly@@ a tells that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her home for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she recalls the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; for each child , Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child &apos;s money . &quot;
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha Nur@@ sery was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
it tells us that at first it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right for them . &quot;
every day I remember how the city and war were once .
&quot; as our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy follows him .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which will cause in@@ convenience in their lives . &quot;
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border of Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in a ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name mo@@ m Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants coming here .
&quot; sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you from Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings her to the hospital if they are ill , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , she masks them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao Family ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans travel together often and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he rep@@ lies smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a blind alley leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small home .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the ais@@ les , travellers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones quietly . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves in her album with many photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;s fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they &apos;ve gone on . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang of Twitter users .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the police announcement , the app was reported to investigate and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the min@@ ors for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region .
&quot; while news about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often dark for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cases and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Statement from mainland China &quot; &quot; ) , which published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano make sure that the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ App .
a mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use appliances that are meant for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can up@@ lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions affiliated with the Party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi Regional Capital until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this action , however , viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole set of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cries out after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the &quot; &quot; sleep or death row &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one that ren@@ ders all honor to its name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality catches you up and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into Essen@@ ce of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death . &quot;
&quot; you will become aware that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents built stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; all the districts of the city sought , not my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been plu@@ gged into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had settled down slightly after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof several times . &quot;
I listened to my voice through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were al@@ lied to a magnificent image that filled my expectations completely and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are fre@@ eing the mind from the lamp , but it &apos;s just not interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; let me hear how you write &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were watching me .
&quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes , not to the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old and it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure about my thing when I replied : &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought you had forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father straight away . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself . &quot;
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I &apos;ve got all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike otherwise , they have given me a larger cell this time . &quot;
I have to share it with only one more prisoner and must immediately put me on without waiting for her permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old way of communication : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; first @-@ resp@@ ite . &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a resp@@ ectable middle aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be recognized , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase away all these crow@@ s , which refresh themselves in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from a distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams will be heard every day .
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; &quot; th@@ under &quot; , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus the secret was venti@@ l@@ ated : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot;
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he feels like that . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant conversation , &quot; despite the expression of his facial expression . &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations , which will soon come to an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
&quot; I got used to it , not to answer . &quot;
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly chat .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably stems from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cry .
&quot; give him pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a tr@@ ash collector before or if that belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not take any pleasure in it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
my half naked body lying on the floor was the perfect electric conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot;
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fearful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch . &quot;
&quot; what you can rely on , however , is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ta@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . not only in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to the very heart of San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special ti@@ lt against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b contem@@ plates his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian fled the second generation , &quot; he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into water Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the sli@@ ps speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as well as drinking water in the public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms , and is the main reason for the concert announcement . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said the concert was &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the j@@ ord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to advocate &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an ever @-@ clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender norms to body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tro@@ mp@@ ed unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; honour kill@@ ings &apos; - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jord@@ anian lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a 1954 law anti @-@ crime law , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely &quot; &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen . &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known for not to shy away from subjects that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b states that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was in@@ tim@@ ated to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song called &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats quite often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan talking about gay and les@@ bians &apos; rights and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to point out later that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but was stre@@ amed but only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ce , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ evo , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service held several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they were critical to the problems linked to the deeply rooted corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan did not stop M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial kinds . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years ago , in which armies from the west of Japan were mar@@ ching to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only truth - and a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !

I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a car of 18 metres was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; outside appearance and personal care were rare as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian adol@@ escence away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rau@@ b and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these sophisticated hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ paralleled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ex@@ centric look@@ outs , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to trade their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain training in hair@@ dressing arts , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community . &quot;

this is the question addressed to the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la @-@ li@@ aison campaign ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) that encouraged young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
&quot; only recently , their country was the setting for a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it . after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in international terms , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , once accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now assimil@@ ate it into its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
&quot; the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , who are to be handed over personally . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he was planning to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent encour@@ agement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war into a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former fighter squ@@ ander@@ ed me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ator , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer . &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was also tired of the war , he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the kick @-@ off , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
&quot; for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice by the state looked upon all the Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making society more equ@@ itable in this country . &quot;
&quot; for one purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard so far and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hated them , were only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives does hurt me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ san@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would prevail after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and this is fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC apply now to peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of hazards , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a women &apos;s sword about the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not yet emerged overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what &apos;s happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that address the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious que@@ ens and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had heard of the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she eventually moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them throughout the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you smu@@ dge ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wing .
&quot; OC Media : in which patient wings were you laid , in the men or women of the women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me at the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
they made absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets above ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex so that everything was just bad talk and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have cup size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved to an apartment and just a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark windows and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 got on it . &quot;
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was lazy . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment I wanted to invo@@ ke my mo@@ m via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this psychological barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when chat@@ ting with a camera , I really effort to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do to those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been sitting in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not exclude a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably would like to invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to prove themselves to Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and say they have attacked some village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is that just a suggestion , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about this . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was regarded , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer then now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : how is it possible , under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore jeans @-@ jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bent my hair on me .
&quot; before the Russian Theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
they often say it to children when they make fun of sick people .
&quot; OC Media : so , they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace hold on ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; he who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
during the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up breeding places .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ow ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what , the cab@@ ar@@ ets have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think with transitions to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
for me it &apos;s the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I &apos;m so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not so sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 moved the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything any more . &quot;
he died shortly thereafter .
&quot; it was not the only suicide occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work because of the persecution of the Iranian government .
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa community living in Iran is located , was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard for the native Arab population to earn their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is systematically den@@ ying the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by drought in the region , and to destroy the local agriculture , as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youngsters has now risen to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and have a university degree in 45 % . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with resi@@ dency in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa , and even Arab names in the workplace cannot be tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa must endure , human rights activ@@ ist al@@ arms raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the web site A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - respond with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even place well @-@ thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , women still earn less money today despite the same education as men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later in different areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still spread across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer dou@@ bly and thre@@ ef@@ old . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless , when I come to talk about skin color , racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or to black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , in both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to keep silent . &quot;
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence in addition to sexu@@ alized violence .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refer both to sex and to the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I too refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a horri@@ fying and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural assimil@@ ation , in order to promote their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement tot@@ ality , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was established to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
&quot; because of my dark skin and due to my existence , I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor rejected , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdist@@ an Region of Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - dedicated to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persecuted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed churches to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ay@@ ans women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women represent &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ lich@@ ein@@ eph@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had been violent to her . &quot;
&quot; a little time has passed since the end of their relationship and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , the obvious display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was also useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; cont@@ ent@@ 1 Imp@@ act and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that prevents nothing of Paragu@@ ay@@ an &apos;s laws : good approach , inadequate implementation of impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studio , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements went to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of ads in police came from women .
there were over 5000 advertisements for domestic violence at the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads also came here .
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were mi@@ stre@@ ated physically , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; 9 women who do not do so will come to any woman who is reported to report in Paraguay on account of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 on every woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse , &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; in August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least twelve cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . she should regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severely recognizable : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had liked this for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was ill @-@ treated . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ as case , everything began with psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ predictable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Port Ell@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ e@@ asing ) are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare Fem@@ ini@@ d on an independent criminal record and to punish it harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; the legislative text has been modified in some respects to also win MEPs for the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had intended to impose a large part of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs that the victims of violence must present themselves , if they simply want to report and receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer considered something normal . &quot;
&quot; whoever is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get out of the trap . &quot;
we need to report so long before mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been modified , among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim .
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered to be a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after a newspaper ban continues to attack
&quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information , &quot; is published on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Alban@@ ian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were arrested and brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after putting his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , alongside his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been serving the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander of the Defence Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sultan is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the intelligence service , to restrict and in@@ timi@@ date public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent magazine reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested a paper with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties tied at the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having placed judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in a dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Board of Directors , was invited by ISS to the Special Unit and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS seized the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely , after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper in any way , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of disturbing public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of State . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ ani@@ ans each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . &quot;
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; on 22 August 2016 , he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government of Mali . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order by which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; extended three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ equi@@ p the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was injured in Oman in recent times .
&quot; further injuries include closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ inum and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Alban@@ ian authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Alban@@ ian authorities to : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can ex@@ ert their ri@@ ghtful human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his understanding &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more severe impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Ser@@ b healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; I am also starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
&quot; GM : what do you think about the important current science topics in your country , and in general in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients , instead of being a mo@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are convey@@ ed differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is a need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa opposite Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here .
the system that magazines can only make articles accessible to pay ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers are changing world food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ lan@@ terns , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding .
&quot; the patents applied not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ el types . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton is still a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , but he still needs a salad , but he needs longer , because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der in a river is lying around which I have to drop .
&quot; so we have to do that right now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; if they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very cau@@ tious and stri@@ ves to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement that is growing ever bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman @-@ let@@ tu@@ ce of the Out@@ lan@@ der variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the move from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the free open source software movement that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders simply allow others to breed their seeds so as to breed their own varieties , and not to cut it off immediately - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; it is said that seed plays a role in larger contexts , such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the open @-@ source movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; &quot; he says and refers to the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is said , for example , on farmers markets . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seeds sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others , as opposed to patent seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always available . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass grown plants like wheat are patented in an even larger scale than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Ques@@ tion of Visi@@ bility
&quot; plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for gro@@ wers decreases with more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four genetic banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property requires other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; such protection does not prevent innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires and certainly does not promote innovations .
&quot; if one has to wait so long to breed to plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle has already been lost . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to facilitate their work .
this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources .
&quot; in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant traits : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as a bree@@ der , we finally have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety , also breed their own values into them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but rather than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents possess , it creates most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the experim@@ entation or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know my competitors will sell my grades myself in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected against competition for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; while the US seems to be leading the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
she also supports her to come to Open Source seeds and sell her own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open @-@ source licence , which is ultimately a form@@ less and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding are different from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open @-@ source seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed seed systems , which should coinci@@ de with the official launch of the official start @-@ up next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity globally to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities strongly critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; despite this attack and the scor@@ ing of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law , it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barrier and fail to yield . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar &apos;s Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship apparatus of the Egyptian government , was even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider of which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video as police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if blocking the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; I have succeeded in arran@@ ging the feeling of a siege state to me ; an arrest , an attempted murder , a sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courageous walk the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ te documented the closure of providers by transferring internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users may have access .
&quot; the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed to court against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day , newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; ebe smoked pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ ship to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; on 16 August , the newspaper &quot; Extra , &quot; known for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper stated the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes etc . all that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way to call : that &apos;s not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , chief editor of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , when distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only fires and then asks questions . &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it uses ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against calling the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; in memory , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; to call Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ as per federal state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has been paying particular attention to the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a fav@@ ela through the use of a massive police station and to permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this led to a decline of violent deaths . after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for human beings . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state to use means and means that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an inv@@ alu@@ able point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; aber@@ rated balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
one week it is now that the police cl@@ ung the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations carried out by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebel forces outside Damascus have been under siege . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to traditional , planted foods , and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P the French news agency : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to raise money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ appro@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 4th 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the shortage of fuel , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from the regions &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
creating new jobs especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October .
&quot; fires have also been registered in the Gali@@ cian region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks , spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite photographs , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and anti @-@ fire measures by the state .
people wondered why the Civil Guard was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was critic@@ ised by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val proceeds in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from easily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continued to spread like in a vi@@ cious circle . &quot;
&quot; these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when inhabitants searched for information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used its own civil protection data through the application fo@@ g@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers didn &apos;t stand the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the road from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneur

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; at dawn , the boy was to burst . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ oo party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been killed by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country , along with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar , which were heavier than he himself to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so we could not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without documents in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
during the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , walked alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church , which distributed food to the needy twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that because of relatively high ratings , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers have in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ trained personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only then be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially applied for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , depend on the hospitality of friends , or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
and so was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ brid@@ led willingness helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans operated businesses , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , go far beyond the Italian restaurant business and retail and go back to the country that forced him to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development to the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are standing . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; citizen report : Egypt &apos;s draft bill enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ et &apos;s Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament checks a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority .
&quot; users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submission to the authority , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step might be sentenced to six months in prison or the tri@@ b@@ ulation of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty parliamentary members , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP reached a proposal to introduce stric@@ ter pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high civil servant . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposal , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photos on August 13 , 2013 when he took photos of demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the presidential election of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan , like more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested at the same incident , waited four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent burden of inter alia , weapons ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iz@@ a released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ ar@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested for the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ gations of Tunisi@@ an activists to pass @-@ through documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was li@@ stens chi@@ ef@@ ly to a si@@ ghted action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , according to the plan explicitly endor@@ ses a controversial draft bill , which would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that these are all un@@ law@@ fully preserved mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , a light sheds light on how the Pres@@ idential Plans will look like the support of the bill . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the appointment of his sources by stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on 9 May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Information Office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts assume that by doing so the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat tran@@ spi@@ red to register as an &quot; organis@@ er of the spread of information &quot; in the provincial government . &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services for removing contents and forcing them upon request to issue user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications indicated that the site was blocked because it was &quot; &quot; an information source working with groups to send a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
&quot; following this week &apos;s backed @-@ up documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to hei@@ gh@@ tened supervisory powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and to install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions on the part of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
