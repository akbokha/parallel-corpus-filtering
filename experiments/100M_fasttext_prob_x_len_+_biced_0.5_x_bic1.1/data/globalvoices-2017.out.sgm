<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and run their sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the murderous plot of an oil magnet with the help of Julia Roberts as a law student."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very playful love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never holds behind the mountain, as one says so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican front elections, was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, welcomes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trump's worldview agreed not with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trump intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a great deal of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump broke his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man despite - or perhaps because of his contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters to be the racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people said one of my friends is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think differently in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, did they perhaps want to say that they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">White and Whiplash (white against all other ethnicities); the white and whiplash of white in allusions to white and whiplash as the big Van Jones described has exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world value the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan man, whose story, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trump, however, a vast portion of the white America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan inquired. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they shouted and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, that is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was pleased, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trump's country," "said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province have in common with the children of the Paraguaan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music, which is played in both places, not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students became the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered youth a rare glimpse of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the turmoil you learn to play the trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located on the top of the largest garbage dump of Paraguayan capital - are based on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers began to turn parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments of remanufactured material and is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated in liberias waters illegal fishing before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were upset by this and were little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles were mobilizing swiftly against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing license."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority, remembers."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillaging the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had expelled from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, director of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing of ecosystems can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail's pace with which information is circulating between individual countries, the actions take place nowadays in real time, with traceability to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also attentively follows the activities of ships, when they move on the open sea via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships which fish in prohibited areas. even so suspicious cycling routes are discovered, such as those indicative of a ship loading their caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not financially viable."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which will lose eight members of HISH-i network each year due to illegal fishing, which enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also uneven illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include campaigns such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, phantasienames, fish-protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbridled control system," "says Long." "earlier a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say 'You should not run my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"yet another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and just this legal loophole, FISH-i tries to close."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread falsified licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships using multiple fraudulent identities and found and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing across great distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track the illegal ships that like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered from satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana sea protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of every single trackable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources to study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that previously fished without a license and hardly had to expect consequences, now know that they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets which were prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear from illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined forces, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also combat illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "Safety is the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph. in October it was Greko 1, a ship under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative way of working to protect the oceans really works across the ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rate is one of the highest in the world (inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine persists, the referendum aimed at regaining its institutional structures and closing a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">"at the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, everything."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - everything was possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"this day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Over there the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a lying on which people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fixed the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him a load of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrifying... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and were wearing eyes."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"close to the entrance, people munched quietly on their mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father saw that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you think asshole?" ""</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me otherwise?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">"their names were changed here, and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order was removed from the top that they should be laid."</seg>

<seg id="267">The 'spoils' of war</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at the age I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>

<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could take part in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>

<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>

<seg id="287">"we weren't poor, but he still brought clothes home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense accused me of being a conspiratant in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay me a burden of what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="295">"well, you were executing people during the dictatorship. but why would the corpses disappear?"</seg>

<seg id="299">"I asked myself again and again: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been possible to put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why would their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Didn't these people also have families that were handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that one can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="309">I was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="357">"the police of the prefecture of KYOTO excused for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the mistake had already been contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation)," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News talked about the phenomenon of the "awful" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "awful" "has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is a matter of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents caused by seniors. this corresponds to a 10% share."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and use active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost genetics or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"however, some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English language is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the enlisted and enigmatic phrases, which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for a number of languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source of translation."</seg>

<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible."</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters included recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was caught and recommended to use the Users, VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="417">"the article is part of a series entitled" Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen "(" Flying Skins, decaying Schools ") edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before she graduated from university, she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud about her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"she, from which something has become," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began working as a criadita for the family. as Crimean tas, in Paraguay there are more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money hands over their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over his head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that children have to pay countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and mistreatment - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criaazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for several years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke to Crimean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Criminta is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criaazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they can conclude their education, improve their position in society and" make something out of themselves, "is handed over to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies the exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and might even be starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criaazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in the Paraguayan households, has a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent shocks."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criminta in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira proposed a stick to Marín until she suffered lethal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Crimean azgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be a landmark case - for the first time in the history of Paraguay, a case of Criaazgo was brought to trial."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Everyday of a Criminta</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Crimean tas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criminta to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked every day between four and six hours."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner it was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food either." I was allowed to fetch more books from the house's library than food out of the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>

<seg id="500">"image of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">"public domain, CC0."</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted to draft legislation on "the regulation of use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"based on the law, a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a finer."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm 7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede Application "which is run and used via the Internet to communicate with others through voice, video alignment and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is not clear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not give evidence on how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration. it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt is planning to build a firewall at national level around Facebook, because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" Lead Research Technician ") at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that as they violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to justice."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft" stands in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, maximizing the control and ensuring that no deviating narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the Kurdistan Mountains in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards who strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus SA saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persican Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and flourishing of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the free wilderness is minimal and goes against zero. when the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza passionately shows a different side of her country, which is not only composed of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the northeast of Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who had been affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a state prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring settlements Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had all coastal cities disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the Fukushima Prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, already alone for this reason, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their houses."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local perspective what progress has been made six years later to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures until December 2015."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to list the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima is the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, six years after the catastrophe, they still endeavoured to resettle the evacuation of temporary shelters (Cassily, Kazetsu juutaku)."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuated Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were leaving behind the disaster, were transferred to final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo paper, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures of the agrarian country, the tsunami and the nuclear accident moved extensively into the country."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land can be used again in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land are located in Fukushima, lying in the" nuclear explosion zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima is still far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuated population. she asked them about the status of rebuilding and how their feeling has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey reported that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in catastrophes prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">As to those who had to evacuate from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its commemoration of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear disaster that Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"in early 2016, more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated camps are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="627">"Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central in Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after planting, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory was gradually losing its facilities until the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene remembers exactly to have heard that in Mañalich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the community already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>

<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound is to remain, according to the 2016 published report" Agricultural Prospectors "by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>

<seg id="690">A song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a number of traveling workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop means that the young participants explore topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyillak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section of the street in Western Canada where almost two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases have not been clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths did not always speak the languages of the First Nations linguistically."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation was recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"this way, they can grow and as well as our youth move forward"</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">"in the comment section, the reader and supporters of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also contribute and add the verse in syllables (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):"</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "Cart models of the dishes" ") of each dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or going on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokier district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets today."</seg>
<seg id="724">"with Naver matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in the special sale: new mobile phones decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerated magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an Imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case ikura or Lachsbetrayed is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there anyone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also paddy balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver matt blog post. or follow Twitter the hashtag # 3.</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you like to learn more about the origins of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the extremists and communists regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this fight entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely displaced the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the communities that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" "apening a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "learning with drug trafficking" ")."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vivique Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves, to go and to search for tombs, to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he was supposed to be back, but he never returned." Emma Veleta says: "it is very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need a training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't get it off because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "apria vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent to it or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants to be Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the" "heroic deeds" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they mockish those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of human beings is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village would be justified by the fact that they were "soaked."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L., Mexico City, wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family is plundered with threats. ""</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article "The Forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, tortillas and make" chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the blood of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence caused by the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "apers a Vivir Con El Narco", "Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby, which was full of people looking at the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to innocence.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "That is Nigeria". "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the incident portray the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">"it shows rows of charred bodies, lined up on the floor while people look at them."</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photograph has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, particularly in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one was left to count corpses," "said a resident to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been cut, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated metaphorically."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the occasion for the attack remained unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeriah and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture from the DR Congo re-emerged, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>

<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the image was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments, like this example, falsely affect the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could be beaten, rape and some dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong subjects or frames (frameworks) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murderings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are umpteen people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue, and does the actual horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent imagery has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that refusing images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images can desensitise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologist experimented with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, but what actually can be used detached from the context or in a totally abusive way."</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog called untranslatable (currently unclear) makes an effort to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">"such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, often very complex or specific."</seg>
<seg id="946">"some of these unmistakable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese sausage) and others, deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish soaker)."</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are necessary in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" untranslatable "Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Raise your parents in recognition of how they endeavored to keep you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi - The comfort or laziness you feel after you have been warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they defy other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish even more of these" "confusing" "words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are."</seg>

<seg id="972">"according to a statement from the catastrophes of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missing because of the floods and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="973">"over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (May 26) and circa 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations."</seg>
<seg id="974">"the rain falls on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly."</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still inaccessible.</seg>

<seg id="1006">We don't look all the same.</seg>

<seg id="1027">"this narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin."</seg>

<seg id="1031">It clears the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"for the creators of the project, the following applies:"</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure rooms, in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening "is often associated with" understanding "these events instead," listening to appreciating, feeling, engaging. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and presentation lead to the audience's attention."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyugu tells the tale of the hare and the vian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his tale, John Nyugu is asked:" what about an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own stories of history."</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico claims to re-establish sovereign debt by the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which were up to 72 million US dollars, various religious and bourgeois organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march started at Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juana."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neuro-testing of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reestablishing debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed remuneration that operates in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"the people of Puerto Ricos are refusing to pay a debt, which is not theirs."</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be reconciled with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the territory's integrated territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"hence the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation, with a focus on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of citizens, measures imposed from the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people."</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration was called "Night Watch for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">"the Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year."</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">"more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"at this year's re: Publica, the annual digital culture conference held in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Investigation)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available license-free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are set up and what are the real costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movement for free knowledge, have worked on site to look beyond the mist that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been incarcerated in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current status or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing Bassel paying a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, writer and attorney Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "Military Police Bassel" "had taken part in Adra as a" "strictly secret" "command of the Military Court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Braun, a designer, technologist and currently passed the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassel's cultural prototypes was more forward-looking than the work, which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here, Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influence."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do all it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This move into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion, sharing his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I'm overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought the Internet to me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other detainees how they use computers, at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabuch that she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available license-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora titled "It Happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">"it happens at every visit,"</seg>
<seg id="1229">"that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,"</seg>
<seg id="1230">"that I lose my mind at the moment in which we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that each of the dangers doesn't matter to me,"</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and guards"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crowding of prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I'll enter every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">"which I carry with passion,"</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">"I quickly return to my loneliness,"</seg>
<seg id="1239">"to bring back all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And laugh and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">"on the first anniversary of Bassel's imprisonment, Ghazi wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="1243">"a year goes by, my soul"</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in detention."</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: director of corruption indicted after release on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to corruption in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment on account of misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which happened on 19th April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to refer back to his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not call the action good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary proceedings against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" disgusting. ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been sent off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid papers and motivating speeches, he could consult and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is willingly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contrary to that!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Biton Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director had no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks moral return and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served himself only by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man, who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Mahel, to remind him that a thief has been in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are part of Samora Mahel's prison which will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously affirmed that" an ambitious man is capable of anything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"at the same time, an ambitious person is criminal." "</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censuses many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splitting bins.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took up their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "[Burmese]" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abusive connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts in the purpose of their use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, a chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooshortage Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook must be more analytical before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(spacers)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who propagate hate speech, get a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proven that the censorship of buzzwords is often a cat and mouse game, using social networks simply to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to extinguish his posts when he only wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail was not consistent with the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinion against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post office was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khins believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but so it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have prohibited such words as" "chair" "or" "hereditary curry." ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to rectify the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't include hate speech, but were nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat a pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check if Facebook removed the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"if you are a doctor, then heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have been using social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should also fuel violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine region, where thousands of Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for failing to control the rampant hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"prior to this amendment of the married couple, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities adhered to the practice, and in May 2016 it came to a large public scream. at that time Brother Harry4sad Maharaj, a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere unless the age determines maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a partner of the UN Convention on Children's Rights, the minors are defined as" "every person under 18 years of age." ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married at 15 was in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements committed to abolishing the infant's laws, followed at the foot, and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the toe, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but early 2017 the bill was decided against the infant before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would already make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook which reposted Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against childbirth was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once approved by the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthralled because the laws of the child's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it took too much time and unnecessary talk which conceals the heart of the matter, but do you know what? child marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price."</seg>

<seg id="1391">"the English Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Produced by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">"for over a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy internet users are used to using recirculation tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to remain locked, several mirror sites (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) now appear."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid out all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"however, the content remains accessible despite legal prohibition."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also stated that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked."</seg>

<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server continues the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a suhlense rhinoceros, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar endeavours to bring Nepal an animal world to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that direct the attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class position helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was just resting at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to kneel down pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he ought to know it, for he was already facing Tigers face to face,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not interfere with the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he immediately sits down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos to promote the protection of wild animals.</seg>
<seg id="1435">"his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wild animals, however, is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, it is best to avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband, and the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm to get this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a fake and violated by her family and community after having addressed a married relative."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives is also common among men. however, they have far fewer assignments to fear if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and dedicated to the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in their discussion was women who did not name their husbands on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to speak out loud the name of their husbands, is a custom that they have perpetuated and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition attests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not think this is considered a deceitful woman as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply entrenched that we never had thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home at home."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My wife-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate. "some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she only kicked away during the whole exercise, another decided to release the whole issue of frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the rush of adrenaline to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands on behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"over the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared at her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that shows the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced red point if he would do it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the club club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip with every discus club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about many things, such as our identities attached to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to tell certain things loud, no matter how small they happen to one."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salsa-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much quarrelling and discussion on the advantages of their own dress code, the moral associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own couple of Kurtas (Obershirts) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - lie at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports other people about what we're talking about and what we're doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Correspondents from the Video Volunteers community come from marginalised groups in India and make videos on stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "messages from those who experience themselves" and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges.</seg>

<seg id="1583">The police of Zambézia warned the people that bald men could be in Mozambique's target of attacks.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"photo: Another Bolin / Flickr, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="1585">"a new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for organ trading, probably for disbelievers, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government has now called a number of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the borough of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia declared the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the target of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that in the South African country the UN carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">"persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who are planning to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">"attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, warned the Muslim police according to the latest murderings of three bald men based on their body parts."</seg>
<seg id="1597">"two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place."</seg>
<seg id="1598">"Husky Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:"</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">"the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power that generated riches."</seg>
<seg id="1601">"in recent days, three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country."</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the blog poor Snaippa that indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">"I MÖCHTE GERNE EIN Mosambique, THE SME foams a country in which people would have shame to go to the streets, to demand sex against good marks, to demand decent work and other achievements, a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for disbelievers or" "black magic" "are to be pursued which aim to achieve spiritual riches."</seg>

<seg id="1626">"a photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently."</seg>
<seg id="1627">"this story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press."</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(State Danger) after participating in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as an" "internal affair" "and told a speaker that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to call on the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government shared that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. Norway signed an agreement only in June to resume the export of salmon to China as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"during the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair."</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China for the release of Liu, as stated in a statement on June 30:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to abolish all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"they are to meet and receive all visits that they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world."</seg>
<seg id="1651">The United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy calls on the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the U.S. Embassy summons a furious reply from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with China that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had major concerns whether the fuss surrounding Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada &gt; Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China to provide adequate medical care to Liu and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Liu attorney told AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room at the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells about:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and release the rights reserved for the exercise of these rights."</seg>

<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished, led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"personally, I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo, Charter 08 signed for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they were compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, one hears that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the main point of the topic, the good old lyre appears again from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the responses to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our political system, really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He answered corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country is our city?"</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our noteworthy K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"while Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points out regarding the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore" was not a country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said in Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, really associates himself and is aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review outlines the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "faithfully commit a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, are we only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is both land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the Cabinet's cabinet, statements by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not only defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore expands and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" "the defense of the country especially", "but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">"their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumours of certain parts of the world exposed and another facet is to be shown."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, Editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most posed to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," "I answer." "I'm from Canada." "since 1994 I live and back in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on which situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know each other, there is little difference between Canadians and Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everyone loves Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1754">Gay marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "apologies."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"it wouldn't matter to me, for example, if you'd confused me with Johnny from Dallas."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, to be called" nice, "is basically to be pious - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "does not have personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to pay no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major property of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau looks at the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video which periodicals the junta, which in 2014 seized power and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continued to dominate the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour group describes a young man who tells the instructions of his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not politically politically, the music video indirectly refers to the continued military supremacy of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month even the Charlie Chaplin video" "The Dictator" "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves in the position of the country under the rule of junta."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the infamous program for" adjustment change "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are viewed by the junta as critics."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear requirements are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, which monitors online content and prosecuted persons accused of having slandered the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand is committed to "Lese Majesty" (Majestic Violence).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">"two days later, it came to a coup in the army."</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "confusion" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border of Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in a teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name mom Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian migrants coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings her to the hospital if they are ill, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, she masks them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao Family (with her daughter Mercalli, who has a yoghurche) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel it suits her, because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans travel together often and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he replies smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a blind alley leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small home.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have seen what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula are from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the aisles, travellers consult their telephones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves in her album with many photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she presents her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya's fueron," she repeats every time. "they've gone on."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app" "prevent access to terrorist information". ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the police announcement, the app was reported to investigate and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online scams, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while news about digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often dark for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme cases and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" Images from mainland China "(" "Statement from mainland China" "), which published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano make sure that the people use the official Jingwang-App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use appliances that are meant for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can uplift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the Party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office during operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Urumqi Regional Capital until 1 August to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards. ""</seg>
<seg id="1990">"this action, however, violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole set of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>

<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that has been plugged into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had settled down slightly after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke through the silence, shouting" Allahu Akbar "from my house roof several times."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I listened to my voice through silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we were allied to a magnificent image that filled my expectations completely and completely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you are aware that you are freeing the mind from the lamp, but it's just not interested in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have screamed it all the way up to the office of security service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the Colonel Ghassan was there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now."</seg>

<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes were watching me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you really dare to look into my eyes, not to the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old and it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure about my thing when I replied: "I hadn't thought you had forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father straight away."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father is equal to that."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence lies in my nose to this day.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a mental torture, which I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in the first office, I leave everything I carry with myself."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>

<seg id="2036">"unlike otherwise, they have given me a larger cell this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with only one more prisoner and must immediately put me on without waiting for her permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old way of communication: beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell-mate was a "first-respite."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a respectable middle aged man, who looks similar to me and is called" the doctor. ""</seg>

<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>

<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was ventilated: in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the traitor and terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - thus they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the narrow field of view of their world view."</seg>

<seg id="2057">"I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he feels like that."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant conversation, "despite the expression of his facial expression." my boy, you are still young, you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations, which will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"I got used to it, not to answer."</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly chat.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">In punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably stems from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner delights in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot withhold your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams were not enough for him yet, so they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked myself if the investigator had worked as a trash collector before or if that belonged to the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they intertwined four cables to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour three of them alternated, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling and did not take any pleasure in it, which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod."</seg>

<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with themes such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. not only in his hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to the very heart of Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special tilt against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib contemplates his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian fled the second generation, "he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so because of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he poured into water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the slips speak lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as well as drinking water in the public during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms, and is the main reason for the concert announcement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the deputies and former press spokesmen of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said the concert was" "just" "cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continued to advocate" intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simple rhetoric, but actually reflect an ever-clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender norms to body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently tromped unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honour killings' - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordanian lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a 1954 law anti-crime law, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be held in prison indefinitely" "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known for not to shy away from subjects that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib states that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was intimated to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in Lavla al 3aib and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song called" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words," get what you want "- whether it is faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan talking about gay and lesbians' rights and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya, to point out later that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was streamed but only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuce, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuevo, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemitic realm, there is nothing new that the government sanctifies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service held several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they were critical to the problems linked to the deeply rooted corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaibs concert is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan did not stop Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kinds. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman was a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these large, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years ago, in which armies from the west of Japan were marching to the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi."</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street raub and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these sophisticated hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there, experts face each other in order to show who can create the most excentric lookouts, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to trade their weapons against hairdressing tools and to obtain training in hairdressing arts, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Foto: Valentina Monsanve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel emitted to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is the question addressed to the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation Bogotá and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the Carta por la-liaison campaign (Letters to Reconciliation) that encouraged young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the setting for a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it. after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"in international terms, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, once accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now assimilate it into its ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter, who are to be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent encouragement."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war into a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between, "told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter squandered me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranator, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said," "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "he said," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer." suddenly tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him completely, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was also tired of the war, he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the kick-off, students and some of the FARC leaders came to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice by the state looked upon all the Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making society more equitable in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for one purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard so far and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I've often seen as monsters and even hated them, were only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsanve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would prevail after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and this is fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC apply now to peace, to a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of hazards, including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a women's sword about the local LGBTQ community has not yet emerged overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what's happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that address the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queens and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had heard of the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, she eventually moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them throughout the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round through the WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a male voice saying:" here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard one sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you smudge? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know there was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had received everything and started to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right pulmonary wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which patient wings were you laid, in the men or women of the women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me at the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets above; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex so that everything was just bad talk and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and just a few hours later, under the window, a car with dark windows and a numbering plate with a 95 got on it."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without identification, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment I wanted to invoke my mom via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"but we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this psychological barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when chatting with a camera, I really effort to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do to those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been sitting in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not exclude a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably would like to invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to prove themselves to Kadyrow's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and say they have attacked some village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is that just a suggestion, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about this. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called" "non-traditional" "orientation have already happened in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was regarded, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer then now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to" "civilisation", "but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">"OC Media: how is it possible, under the Sharia law?"</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore jeans-jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never bent my hair on me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theater in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't talk about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say it to children when they make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so, they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace hold on?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who smiled and laughed at first, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic worsened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschow?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature is, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have what, the cabarets have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think with transitions to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it's the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry I'm so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not so sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwa community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 moved the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwa community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide occurred in August within the Arab Ahwa minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work because of the persecution of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwa is suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, where a large part of the Arab Ahwa community living in Iran is located, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard for the native Arab population to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and privations."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime is systematically denying the Ahwazi-Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also built a variety of dams, the waters from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to destroy the devastation caused by drought in the region, and to destroy the local agriculture, as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youngsters has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and have a university degree in 45%."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residency in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their ancestor and surname in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwa, and even Arab names in the workplace cannot be tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwa must endure, human rights activist alarms raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with the intersectional not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the web site Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - respond with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even place well-thought-out scientific and social arguments against me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money today despite the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later in different areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still spread across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer doubly and threefold."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless, when I come to talk about skin color, racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or to black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, in both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and sing" Kumbaya my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that there is an institutionalized form of racist violence in addition to sexualized violence.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take injustices in her mind, which refer both to sex and to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I too refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a horrifying and marginalized being in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural assimilation, in order to promote their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement totality, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was established to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word" feminism "still lies in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can uplift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin and due to my existence, I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor rejected, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddle against pollution: the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with a surfboard or in canoe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," says Musa. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - dedicated to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive then? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film based in Erbil, Iraq, and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, unnoticed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with the help of suppressed churches to tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# reflicheinephraubin) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had been violent to her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"a little time has passed since the end of their relationship and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena showed for abuse, the obvious display of Ada Báez was also useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women complain at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content1 Impact and Statistics 2 Invisible abuses and a legal system that prevents nothing of Paraguayan's laws: good approach, inadequate implementation of impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay", "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 advertisements went to the District Attorney Office for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 advertisements for domestic violence at the peace courts. 86% of women's ads also came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were mistreated physically, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"these statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "9 women who do not do so will come to any woman who is reported to report in Paraguay on account of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "she said at the end of 2014 on every woman who is refunded for physical abuse," "she said at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"in August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least twelve cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign with the inscription:" without complicity, no impunity. # Nonlinear "photo of Jessie Insulfran Pérez. use with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. she should regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severely recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had liked this for so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was ill-treated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias case, everything began with psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unpredictable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Port Ellas (# fürst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-easing) are part of a campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to declare Feminid on an independent criminal record and to punish it harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his understanding"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serb healthcare system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sámi national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"I am also starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"GM: what do you think about the important current science topics in your country, and in general in Africa?"</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients, instead of being a mover."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are conveyed differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is a need for special academic training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa opposite Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only make articles accessible to pay (the so-called "paywall") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers are changing world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine dealing with solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties such as Outlanterns, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cartel types. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"Morton is still a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, but he still needs a salad, but he needs longer, because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if a boulder in a river is lying around which I have to drop.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that right now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"if they stand trial, no one can breed a new type of lettuce, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very cautious and strives to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement that is growing ever bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" "Open Source" "breeding)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman-lettuce of the Outlander variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the move from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the free open source software movement that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders simply allow others to breed their seeds so as to breed their own varieties, and not to cut it off immediately - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"it is said that seed plays a role in larger contexts, such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the open-source movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," "he says and refers to the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is said, for example, on farmers markets."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seeds sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others, as opposed to patent seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always available."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that mass grown plants like wheat are patented in an even larger scale than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for growers decreases with more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto's Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genetic banks and co-operation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property requires other breeders because" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not prevent innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires and certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if one has to wait so long to breed to plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle has already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to facilitate their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant traits:" we don't really create the features ourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as a breeder, we finally have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety, also breed their own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass herbicides are needed, breeds into its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but rather than Monsanto) patents possess, it creates most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the experimentation or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patent."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know my competitors will sell my grades myself in a few years," he says. "with a patent, you are protected against competition for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the US seems to be leading the" open source "breeding, the concept spreads quickly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open-source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">She also supports her to come to Open Source seeds and sell her own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol works on an open-source licence, which is ultimately a formless and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding are different from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open-source seed systems, states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed seed systems, which should coincide with the official launch of the official start-up next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity globally to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others - has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also stresses the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes to see more people soon."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censorship apparatus of the Egyptian government, was even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider of which also Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video as police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>

<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if blocking the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"I have succeeded in arranging the feeling of a siege state to me; an arrest, an attempted murder, a summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>

<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also worsened by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed to court against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old killed in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "ebe smoked pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and airship to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"on 16 August, the newspaper" Extra, "known for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio, published the editorial" This is not normal "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper stated the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes etc. all that deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the" "War in Rio" "section.

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, chief editor of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>

<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against calling the violence as a" war.

<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this led to a decline of violent deaths. after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the region of East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations carried out by the United Nations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these areas controlled by rebel forces outside Damascus have been under siege."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to traditional, planted foods, and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to AFP the French news agency:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>

<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, September 4th 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the shortage of fuel, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began "production of fungal seeds coming from the regions" before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires have also been registered in the Galician region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks, spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite photographs, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can take a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2848">"according to Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>

<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could have happened in June as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was criticised by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval proceeds in the same article of the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees from easily inflammable wood, as in a vicious circle, continued to spread like in a vicious circle."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when inhabitants searched for information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used its own civil protection data through the application fog.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers didn't stand the rush of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country, along with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar, which were heavier than he himself to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so we could not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf had left his life without documents in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time, Asharaf was homeless, walked alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church, which distributed food to the needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that because of relatively high ratings, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers have in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and untrained personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only then be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially applied for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation, depend on the hospitality of friends, or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbridled willingness helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2937">"under the law proposal, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who took photos on August 13, 2013 when he took photos of demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the presidential election of elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan, like more than 700 protesters who had been arrested at the same incident, waited four years in prison for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because the prison management failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent burden of inter alia, weapons ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>

<seg id="2945">"the Court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakarany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested for the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
