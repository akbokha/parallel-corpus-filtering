this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally translated maps to Iran for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined to crack down Ris@@ en and called upon him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had said for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly ordered his telephone calls ; &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel information with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack put@@ ative source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower being a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect its sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today , there is communication software that has not yet been published as Ris@@ en &apos;s book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source Trans@@ mitt@@ al System for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , received by us today , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
Secure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that are all endanger@@ ing us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology representatives like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring about mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the nearest environ@@ ment@@ or , the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; specify enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release and on the next unveiled documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eps away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians will discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people all around the world are very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the United States about this matter .
&quot; probably because so far there were no prominent Americans , who came to this scandal in these revelations . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some U.S. countries one needs less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts to rip off school@@ children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked us that all except one of our investig@@ ators had suggestions as to how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a scandal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; this may sound very tr@@ ash@@ ful as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
&quot; representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ ine chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies .
we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally finish the in@@ transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . thereafter he would go to the cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusi@@ astically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to end up in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small boot space !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what happened to me there ? &quot;
a wild stranger is sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at to@@ e tips and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let us take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , with a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ed czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting . &quot;
over the internet you can then invite alien people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business , allowing strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; this is how most guests feel , if they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gore &apos;s mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is in charge of the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to share with you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name , if he had told you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 app@@ rais@@ als that all say : &quot; he can really hold out very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to reject negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
&quot; surprisingly , we trust people most , who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it gets exciting when adding the reputation of a person -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stands out by com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells us too much , for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; My great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m on holiday with my family . &quot;
how is it possible to create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
secondly : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , there was a need that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , business is just running very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front , when confidence was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of a total of 123 million overnight stays had a problem . &quot;
people are rightly familiar with each other .
&quot; if trust is working , won@@ dro@@ us works can be created . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers , who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
they leave one even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is a commercial trade .
&quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves openly and this changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , you can compare it with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place that one visits , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a ta@@ vern tour of which one has never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would shape apartments from the ground up to share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relations , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isol@@ ation@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already been started . lots of parking places belonging to the government , &quot;
were now offered residents . students looking for a place to stay
were taught to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programmes were started
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality already existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am an intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull fitness fan , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you crush yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , and compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves somehow ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I got married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; Bre@@ aking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why do I have to do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; near origin ... &quot; , &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the actions of others turned me into a suspi@@ cious one . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we ro@@ de in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time I feared to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t waste . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day Muslims gathered to pray .
&quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
&quot; understand@@ ably , the feelings were un@@ filtered and I heard from attacks on Muslims or from people that were considered to be Muslim , de@@ ported and killed . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have fought the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually hear people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
the question arises only : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is observed only under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is mis@@ placed .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
&quot; it may stop a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
regular visiting of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant look at people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
&quot; as first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a betra@@ yer . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to find a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m re@@ established the connection with God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept in mind to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian system of government , con@@ formity , and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; one study shows that if you submit to test persons messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims up@@ shot -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective debt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented , talented , very promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a couple of weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne near her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he spent eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , put my shoes off , walked into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with depth , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I &apos;m not an exception in any way .
&quot; when people appear like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air pack@@ et delivery into our social consciousness penet@@ rated , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting them , flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ reli@@ ant structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects , enabling us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are executed at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can s@@ well , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be re@@ gained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known approximately as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying units that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
recently we discovered that flies were working with only one .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ a , the mechan@@ ically most remote controlled aircraft . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of just throwing it right , if they all look , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ a is an exercise in vi@@ gil@@ ance , this machine is here , the Omni@@ Cou@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the necessary ability to perform &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned , or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot is possible in models , the rest is learned directly at flying . &quot;
let us look at it .
&quot; if flying machines are part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half of it fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp shade . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for guys like us , the reward lies in the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ved around each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life has been created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be increased significantly , which greatly improved recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ thi@@ ding black holes ruled through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my sick father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when the wave is over@@ taken , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , teachers in the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ right dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and qu@@ en@@ ched when the waves arrived . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , the Lig@@ o staff declared ins@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured precisely in less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of a nucleus . that is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne described a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties of building such detectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is pretty convenient , because you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; in shades , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice is speaking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally speak the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , one hears the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , embos@@ sed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; No one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass that rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider what that means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , around one hundred times per second , before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe as it never was possible before .
&quot; on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible . &quot;
&quot; much in space we can , practically or basically , not see . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these are opa@@ que .
&quot; the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe ins@@ an@@ ely , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by his own offspring . &quot;
&quot; with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the din@@ osau@@ rs for our arch@@ eological work , so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different point of view of what is happening in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as brave as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sounds and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to everything I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected article . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; pussy , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes .
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; say about playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , raise your mind to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days or four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production , four times episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing this ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a class room , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak about work , so that you understand that I am not just hanging on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I go into work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s as if I turned up troops as if I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as if you wear a high tone , run a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever on it . &quot;
&quot; many people suppose that when I declare to them the sums , that I am persu@@ aded to write that writing is a joy to me . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what it does . &quot;
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I started working and working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the sum is music . the sums are light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you can &apos;t strive for great@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of premature failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sw@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the h@@ um . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ hau@@ led , burned out . &quot;
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her m@@ um@@ my is a single stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming ceased . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was off .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my sw@@ um was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same title work , 15 hours @-@ days , rehear@@ sed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan never sleeps , doesn &apos;t give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no h@@ um .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fa@@ des away ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; lo@@ cu@@ lo@@ ess , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do , you do , you love what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you a h@@ um when you know the bu@@ zz@@ ing , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than two things become aware of me :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; bi@@ bs . &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anybody any more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am titanium and my bu@@ zz grows , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , al@@ ert@@ ness pen@@ cils and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl is letting go in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity is everywhere .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me resol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; not immediately , but it happens to happen . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the amount of labour , the titanium dioxide , that &apos;s just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I complain about shows and TV hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum is dependent on love .
the Sum@@ ma is the current that comes from the lust for life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which god told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic of any guilt .
&quot; it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sw@@ um again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing doesn &apos;t seem to me how to work .
&quot; the truth is aching , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at home rather than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be rather than being a home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ attle around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; mostly I feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and if my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes to play , even on a bad day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the track !
&quot; no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children get ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in there !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the sw@@ um , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and save yourself .
&quot; friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show , when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on the piece , why don &apos;t you take full 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the tot@@ als came back in my spare time . the sw@@ um seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear a unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
now this is my h@@ um .
the tot@@ als of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ ing me that I &apos;m a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan to play the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires burn still .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play the more I hear the h@@ um . the country I created , the marathon , I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me spreads . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , I stir you up to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; that is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures .
&quot; they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , you implant an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circu@@ it@@ ry of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells and cran@@ ial pressure increases with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; to do this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , it managed Jean @-@ François . &quot;
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are im@@ mortal . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
&quot; slowly and after a few weeks , they even died . &quot;
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us alive ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells . &quot;
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just like Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we planted them on the pick @-@ up point of the same individual . &quot;
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- auto transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ cultivate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ cultivate the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario , we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they were taken back , they go back home . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury to and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they did that very well .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we last the motor skills range in the motor Cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , as is the case with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; look now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since then , we have found out much more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot;
I will definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority permit us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them un@@ changeable .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy winds up with us , in Europe . &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally explained to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our choices -- not the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
&quot; at this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ jour@@ n friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are m@@ apped , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the twin top parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain which casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy Spart@@ ans and corporations , who are too anxious to invest it there , where it would be productive and contribute income by which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except the stock markets and to boost real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which do not align themselves with the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe job@@ less , and consequently a low overall economic demand that would promote the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . &quot;
invol@@ un@@ tarily turns the circumstances causing ede@@ ma to kill him .
this is my argument with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many .
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the crucial factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was that it involved the working poor , not only giving them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voice wei@@ ghting in questions of state affairs . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted for a long time --
&quot; like a candle lit very bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burnt out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately constituted a by@@ word for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present @-@ day demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , by gradually under@@ mining politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not about a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because they can be in the government these days , yet not in power , because the power from politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the divisions are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my argument with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they are fed , that they end up star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being exploited , the inequality increases , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more sub@@ merged , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological hyper@@ car cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve men and people indulge their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical application , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one place to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and income comes from revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but do not belong to them . no exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re @-@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is also liberal in which it prefers privileged individuals , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we now experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not busy , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the or@@ ators you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is , -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to acc@@ use China now of doing what the West has done in the 19th century , has a huge smell of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many people are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good @-@ bye to us from compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent denial that a massive throw line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to run , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial . &quot;
&quot; it is true . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the euro@@ zone , have continued to den@@ ying denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ernst ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such stra@@ ined situation , claims that he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the credi@@ tors to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government case , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ph@@ ers who imposed this policy on us stood up : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is faced by someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be equally bear@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an I@@ gel@@ coat and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows on the right of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on IM@@ DB &apos;s website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this rating is given .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where after you &apos;ve looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price is not about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s more concerned about the medium figure , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing so , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes up a lot of ideas for TV shows and by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and when Amazon is out for nothing , it &apos;s up to you , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when to pause , which parts you ski@@ pping or watching again . &quot;
collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com with four repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7,5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the Manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com with four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is the reason for this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is in prison here in prison and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether release is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , could predict -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in case of legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use lots of data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mostly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do so several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
for that there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that is why I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and reason , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , for which they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these pieces together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they took a big personal risk with this decision . &quot;
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first of all competing for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they were able to say : &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some choices in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much smar@@ ter than data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what one does , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
