<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally translated maps to Iran for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined to crack down Risen and called upon him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn Whistleblower and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had said for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and risking to make statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly ordered his telephone calls;"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel information with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack putative source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower being a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect its sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there is communication software that has not yet been published as Risen's book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this technology is SecureDrop, an open-source Transmittal System for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, received by us today, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that are all endangering us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology representatives like Edward Snowden have a chance to bring about misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the nearest environmentor, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [specify enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, has in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeps away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians will discuss how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people all around the world are very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the United States about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because so far there were no prominent Americans, who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some U.S. countries one needs less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except one of our investigators had suggestions as to how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very trashful as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentine chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who stand up and say: "intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally finish the intransparency which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. thereafter he would go to the corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to end up in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what happened to me there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaked at toe tips and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let us take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, with a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Bleed czyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to the investors:" we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet you can then invite alien people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business, allowing strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you are contemplating the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"this is how most guests feel, if they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gore's mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is in charge of the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to share with you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name, if he had told you where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 appraisals that all say: "he can really hold out very well unlocked mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to reject negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we trust people most, who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It gets exciting when adding the reputation of a person -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out by commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us too much, for example:" "I have problems with my mother" "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "My great works of art in your apartment! I'm on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How is it possible to create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, there was a need that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, business is just running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front, when confidence was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of a total of 123 million overnight stays had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">People are rightly familiar with each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust is working, wondrous works can be created."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers, who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is a commercial trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but to call it simply" "rental industry" "is not just the case."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves openly and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, you can compare it with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place that one visits, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a tavern tour of which one has never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from the ground up to share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relations, rather than loneliness and isolationism."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already been started. lots of parking places belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved out. incubator programmes were started</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality already existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder why we can use design in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am an introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull fitness fan,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I decided to outen."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head covering."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you crush yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a declaration of independence for me, and compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet loves somehow?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I got married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word" Breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircraft flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why do I have to do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... "..." in the name of Islam...,... "..." near origin... "," "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu, the actions of others turned me into a suspicious one."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we rode in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was the first time I feared to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Remain in well-lit areas, "" Don't waste. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday at that week -- the day Muslims gathered to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings came:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"understandably, the feelings were unfiltered and I heard from attacks on Muslims or from people that were considered to be Muslim, deported and killed."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have fought the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually hear people say," There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises only: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is observed only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may stop a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting of a mosque leads to a more tolerant look at people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"as first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or a betrayer."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam such as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups maintain their ideology in their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one looks at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised to find a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam reestablished the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept in mind to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show that if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian system of government, conformity, and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows that if you submit to test persons messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood against Muslims upshot -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when assigning collective debt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented, talented, very promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has my brother become such an accomplished young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a couple of weeks after the visit of Suzanne near her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He spent eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, put my shoes off, walked into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think that we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air packet delivery into our social consciousness penetrated, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting them, flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-reliant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects, enabling us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are executed at the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can swell, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known approximately as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying units that only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies were working with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospa, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of just throwing it right, if they all look, is low, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospa is an exercise in vigilance, this machine is here, the OmniCouter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the necessary ability to perform"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned, or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is possible in models, the rest is learned directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines are part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half of it flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopters -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Broadway, the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp shade."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for guys like us, the reward lies in the development and the creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolved around each other in a very distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life has been created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometry gravitational wave observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be increased significantly, which greatly improved recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collithiding black holes ruled through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, they were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when the wave is overtaken, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, teachers in the theory of relativity often lead to a really alright dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and quenched when the waves arrived. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. therefore, the Ligo staff declared insane."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured precisely in less than a thousandths of the radius of a nucleus. that is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne described a co-founder of Ligos, hunting for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties of building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is pretty convenient, because you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in shades, it is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice is speaking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally speak the universe literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, embossed into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrendes noise] No one who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass that rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, around one hundred times per second, before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe as it never was possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this path, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in space we can, practically or basically, not see."</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe insanely, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is obscured by his own offspring."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the help of gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the dinosaurs for our archeological work, so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us a completely different point of view of what is happening in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sounds and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You can dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, I removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected article. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" kitten "for inexplicable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"pussy, I need milk for my beak cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes.</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" say about playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things out, raise your mind to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are in production at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days or four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production, four times episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I'm a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a class room, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak about work, so that you understand that I am not just hanging on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not dreaming about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I go into work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's as if I turned up troops as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you wear a high tone, run a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people suppose that when I declare to them the sums, that I am persuaded to write that writing is a joy to me."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't get me wrong, that's what it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I started working and working and working, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sum is music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, you can't strive for greatness."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of premature failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the swum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the hum. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overhauled, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mummy is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totals did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My swum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same title work, 15 hours-days, rehearsed weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan never sleeps, doesn't give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "loculoess, stupid author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do, you do, you love what you're doing, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you a hum when you know the buzzing, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" bibs. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anybody any more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am titanium and my buzz grows, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it's outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of money, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, alertness pencils and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl is letting go in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me resolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"not immediately, but it happens to happen."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzzing, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the amount of labour, the titanium dioxide, that's just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I complain about shows and TV hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The Summa is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which god told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it's law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the swum again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing doesn't seem to me how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is aching,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at home rather than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be rather than being a home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rattle around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"mostly I feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you think me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and if my teenage daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can take 15 minutes to play, even on a bad day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children get ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in there!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the swum, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and save yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on the piece, why don't you take full 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totals came back in my spare time. the swum seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear a unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like humming, but I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I'm not the buzzing, the buzz is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">Now this is my hum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing me that I'm a titanium. I've never seen a Titan to play the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfires burn still.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play the more I hear the hum. the country I created, the marathon, I run, the troops, the screens, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the other, the right buzz: the buzzing of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of life in me spreads. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think things out, I stir you up to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"that is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans don't have a chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they have heard of one of the most famous, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, you implant an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuitry of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells and cranial pressure increases with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, it managed Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">"slowly and after a few weeks, they even died."</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us alive?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just like Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we planted them on the pick-up point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplantation -- auto transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-cultivate these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-cultivate the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they were taken back, they go back home."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>

<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy winds up with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally explained to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our choices -- not the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sojourn friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are mapped, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the twin top paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain which casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy Spartans and corporations, who are too anxious to invest it there, where it would be productive and contribute income by which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate except the stock markets and to boost real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which do not align themselves with the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe jobless, and consequently a low overall economic demand that would promote the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily turns the circumstances causing edema to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my argument with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course Athenian democracy included too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the crucial factor in the Athenian democracy was that it involved the working poor, not only giving them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they granted them the right to political co-determination with equal voice weighting in questions of state affairs."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle lit very brightly, it is also quickly burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately constituted a byword for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present-day democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, by gradually undermining politics and disempowering it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because they can be in the government these days, yet not in power, because the power from politics is migrated into the economy and the divisions are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my argument with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's about like a herd of carnivores that have so sustainably decimated the animals from which they are fed, that they end up starving."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being exploited, the inequality increases, the overall economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the" demos "keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more submerged, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a pathological hypercar cracy, which makes the film" Matrix "appear as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "or something similar to the society in" Star Trek, "in which machines serve men and people indulge their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of ancient Athens" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical application, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one place to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and income comes from revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but do not belong to them. no exchange between capital and labour, no gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries] in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially against the background of a re-unified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is also liberal in which it prefers privileged individuals, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we now experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfect."</seg>

<seg id="988">"YV: if you're not busy, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the orators you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is, -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I can say that provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to accuse China now of doing what the West has done in the 19th century, has a huge smell of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many people are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say good-bye to us from complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive throw line went through the eurozone, and continues to run, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is true. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the eurozone, have continued to denying denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead of?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>

<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernst...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such strained situation, claims that he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the creditors to find a common solution.</seg>

<seg id="1025">It's worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the troika's trophers who imposed this policy on us stood up: "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has an Igelcoat and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows on the right of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on IMDB's website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this rating is given.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to where after you've looked at a relay, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to underline "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he's more concerned about the medium figure, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing so, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes up a lot of ideas for TV shows and by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and when Amazon is out for nothing, it's up to you, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show, when to pause, which parts you skipping or watching again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom with four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7,5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the Manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom with four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so, exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"there are two very competitive, data-sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is the reason for this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis doesn't work, then this is a bit scary, because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in prison and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether release is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way, could predict -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in case of legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginably use lots of data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mostly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, disassemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do so several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For that there is another tool and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that is why I believe Netflix was so successful, because they used data and reason, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, for which they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these pieces together again and make a show like" House of Cards "does not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they took a big personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first of all competing for TV ideas, then chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they were able to say:" "they tell us the data." ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some choices in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much smarter than data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what one does, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
