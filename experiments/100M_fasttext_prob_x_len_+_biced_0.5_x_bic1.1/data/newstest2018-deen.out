Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel to be dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; everyone who had to get excited , because the car navigation system was a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ at@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but actual - but very informative . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a carpet of fli@@ ck@@ ering that one recognizes as such .
&quot; the large picture postcard was incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; jud@@ gements &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying administration , these arose between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and emerged from the first survey of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon ordered an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the current neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map . &quot;
Elec@@ tor Max IV further@@ ed the project and founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management .
the judgment sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; the comparison of former / today is most impressive , for example , the state capital . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; prim@@ eval recording &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are small plots there today no more farmers - but farmers of the &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; plant . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar gives the historical map an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the judgment sheet , in the area of today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once closed people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich @-@ based Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Venti@@ lation &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was the head of the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so @-@ called Irish . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he forbi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the power plant in Haar in 1905 .
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 . &quot;
young people meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments . &quot;
&quot; the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East is located west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ rig@@ or , which was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change even in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot;
one big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once standing at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days will work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line will take place . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizen &apos;s Rights Group publishes Travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; the National Association for Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and racial attacks . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is supposed to come into effect until August 28 , 2017 , demands special attention to African @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , since a number of question@@ able rac@@ ce @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately targeting minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , which happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip and was arrested by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney Office showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Chapel said . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring any deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report of the FBI , which classi@@ fy the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , following immigration laws passed by local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further race benefit according to AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ fence Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac created a picture on the spot .
&quot; in the right @-@ wing @-@ gra@@ vey@@ ard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s CD@@ U location met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially provided insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ates in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is the alternative marketing route for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ es exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; essential . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep areas .
&quot; the grass@@ land area is a lot of work , and much has to be done with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he did not conduct bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the municipality has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader &apos;s funding . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested up to at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost amoun@@ ting to 71 500 euros , half of them were driven by leaders , one quarter bore the community of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmer remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers or farm women . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss , it was clear : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot;
the County Poli@@ cies ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will enable the state to promote pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the area to be fenced off may not be tor@@ tu@@ able ( incl@@ ination over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Fis@@ her@@ ship Project 2018 , eight participants with 24 plots , who would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are over 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the company &apos;s square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ hed@@ gers would have killed him if he had done it .
&quot; but he attacked its importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to it , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the monument was completed , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete story here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , your afflicted masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ ending waste &quot; on our screens was better to be seen .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture ought to show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a classic bil@@ ingual depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist clip and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to switch it back for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch will not light up the road to the United States . &quot;
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something here . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful men after long and often horrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and this is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever recognise . &quot;
&quot; their torch will not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish team members
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members at a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; the power director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chers , who will compete against Sir M@@ on Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete in her fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that you should observe after a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there .
block critics about Facebook : don &apos;t mess around a public office if you cannot tolerate burning voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he shr@@ ank in the criticism , for sure . &quot;
but he did not put his critics into silence .
&quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington declared : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and that &apos;s why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compla@@ ined this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
it has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever in using Facebook as the primary means of combining himself with his constitu@@ ents and playing his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ man Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not like this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking one critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter recor@@ ders suggested his leadership . &quot;
&quot; and even back then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trading and shipping with Britain , asser@@ ted his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online paper of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not sil@@ ently silence her .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the final round in the past year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open , as it was taken out of the program in the year after I had gained it . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on home ground . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish gig ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy to see how it has gone .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Strasse is in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; said the director of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic inclu@@ sions the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much se@@ amounts , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction works , is a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction company . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers before red lights and shut @-@ off grids is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to go through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; explains Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
she rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless place serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you have not been assigned fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public lift in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car . &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eigner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans converted a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her vibrant , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia is the poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port mined the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has valued timber resources worth $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military and units paid nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
Mass@@ es in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became part of the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Organ@@ ise Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is said in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims each week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bolts have increased because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua , the M@@ um @-@ Mama , from Papua ( the women &#93; of Papua . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ ai , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ y in 2014 , anticip@@ ating that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols off a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ fle @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so severely that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby governmental Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in circles continuously and a bir@@ d@@ song im@@ itating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers about an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imminent danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man for the Palestinian police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security Affairs , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said that he will set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police shot on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but local people say that the mobile Bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so panic , we &apos;re afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here have been delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament called on the officers to take account of the officers and withdraw the mobile Bri@@ gade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a cause of trouble for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free State of Papua &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily deta@@ ined in Pan@@ i@@ ai , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is also out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they retain most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous peoples of Papua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire has reached greater numbers . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the limits of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West @-@ Iran : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ ai is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ov@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua people , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ ai as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , Pan@@ i@@ ai families carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch@@ al tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when the people scre@@ amed .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; said a resident who gave his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and ch@@ illed the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can rev@@ ital@@ ise questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 found that most of the damages from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believed that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : more best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through the Grand Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individual was not supported by two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the five @-@ set classics , which are often very long , but also very appreciated five @-@ pack classics , are thus preserved . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our membership nations did not accept the whole package of reform for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot;
I will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to fill the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizer , the requirements for training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ eller brings forbidden objects to the plane , finds a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among flying passengers sur@@ vey@@ ed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that entered the plane while they were accidentally banned blades or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out over 1,000 people - the one of a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was conducted - also noted that younger travellers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; from those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , which were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent claimed to have wit@@ t@@ ingly carried objects with clin@@ chers through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought about by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly the most frequently . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
&quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 , &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to announce the huge number of orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far supported that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures for turnover increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number for the first time on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : most of the canc@@ ell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently promoted over 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits that from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay 1000 US dollars ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , in a telephone conference with analysts , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la manager does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem until now . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without any major interrup@@ tions . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if major delays occur , the liability of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in flocks . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt is withdrawn because of the return of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions of causing pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt represented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous job in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground @-@ borne o@@ zone . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June that he would delay adher@@ ence to a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulation to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal advice for the P@@ ru@@ ination regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to the deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement setting the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery grounds in Tum@@ lingen am invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius farm is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building on the site have made friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württemberg Register of Ur@@ s : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tum@@ lingen along with the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document , on the hill of the Tum@@ linger hill , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the beautiful village centre of the village . &quot;
old maps dating from the period around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was derived from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied himself with a parish priest remained the owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones were sh@@ attered by Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later in the Second World War it had to be released in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell pieces were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French forces en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
&quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger &apos;s Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was built .
&quot; during the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church steep@@ le and half pl@@ ung@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower @-@ tower existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius system as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as organis@@ er , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is arranged by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , the local leader , speaks the final word . &quot;
the programme starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
&quot; to conclude the Ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organisers put out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade will take place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organisers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to permit approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the land council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only on the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone existed . &quot;
&quot; in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; while the city Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , a few days earlier , the city Vier@@ sen had decided not to approve a second wind @-@ force concentration zone - but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a formation error . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council has once again approved the concentration of wind in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the call .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been made in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in regards to the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ets the construction of four 200 meters high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of ground . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this equ@@ ates to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ se@@ ater households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as an investment in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in the process .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; after police reports , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother , drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
&quot; the business association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , in order to attract the inhabitants of the shopping expedition to the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the business association Christian König announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers who offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite the &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation for commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; in this way , the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active @-@ Tag &quot; &quot; for the well fes@@ tivity and selling Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost the city center while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - up to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of spring , king had said that it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thurin@@ gian towns will take part in the nation &apos;s third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; adverti@@ se for the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine more injured , some of them heavily wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire department , on Wednesday ( local time ) one injured one was in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first one was later found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a matter of luck , the authorities presum@@ ed working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people stayed at the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy at the holiday season .
&quot; after penet@@ rated tran@@ scripts from phone calls Mexico , Tr@@ ump put under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall &quot;
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called for a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned bor@@ der@@ line . &quot;
&quot; the US President critici@@ zed him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &apos; ridi@@ culous &apos; and &apos; dum@@ b &apos; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump terminated the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and ga@@ zed through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists return to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been syn@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever prosec@@ uted for murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in the post @-@ employment organization . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman for Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights lawyer .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice .
&quot; a court physician lays out a blanket over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding county were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process . &quot;
but none of them was ever prosec@@ uted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on their feet for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black people in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer campaign . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election stab@@ s a white ground owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore not came from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her C@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey into prison .
&quot; but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a ly@@ n@@ x mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders includes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence , and has covered the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and when you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual re @-@ creation of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is based on a type of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching , because then we &apos;ll be confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - pressed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene had a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of chief executive member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times .
&quot; on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed actor Dar@@ by Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries out and drives him , fur@@ i@@ ously , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks off into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ti@@ ring . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman suffering from grief stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors , leading Bil@@ lie Holidays g@@ lowing praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is split almost equally between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks takes them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children sit at their heads , record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man who played the clan member .
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then collap@@ ses in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that is not in your heart .
you did that for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience joins the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair ch@@ ats from Atlanta to talk about the night@@ mare with a black pair they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance left behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights . &quot;
he said he had started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the emphasis is in some ways inspiring because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf prepares a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story scenery . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) can be used to show a scre@@ aming street corner including wall and dome in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; in front of this , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ tö@@ chter can pose as a rock musician , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which is moving through his &quot; Ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rh@@ en@@ ish daughters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they perform Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , rent a body in the trunk of Hollywood and give the Kra@@ wall@@ a cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ lessness box .
brutal the scene when he killed Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Eiche ) still has to believe it . &quot;
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are stor@@ med stor@@ my , who hum@@ bly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a great applause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awaited .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to let go of a g@@ able pipe concert in 2013 , five years later , there were great che@@ ers , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; cries went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is looking forward to it .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience not only did a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I draw a positive resume .
Max Lot is working as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where to go anywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have also worked at the school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful broad spectrum that I see here .
&quot; I have to do with different people , with teenagers , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a later @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I have graduated from school .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; I realized for myself that it is the wrong one for me and I want to do something different , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe too , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study the dual study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you do your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from civil engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well , it &apos;s not about extras . &quot;
there are always other people who have a different story behind them each time .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
quantity : for that I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is just like that . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will disman@@ tle more 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , the job cuts , which the general director John Fall@@ on announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where already 4,000 jobs have been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced in a third cost cutting program a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding to Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after an increase of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and shared a NATO Declaration .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; NATO &apos;s opinion is that the explosion on Thursday evening is to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated at the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban claimed that they had executed this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal military attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering raising the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits
&quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that states are bound to cur@@ b the emissions @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Pro@@ visions 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump will boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; the efforts , however , have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature protection groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
the EPA &apos;s website states that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone can &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
common property wants community room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two opposing voices , the council of Flu@@ o @-@ Win@@ ner decided to set up a community room in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the church community is still part of the community , it will not be a planning obstacle for the project to be pursued by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are ho@@ vering such a common room not as a meeting place for the residents of the just @-@ just living , but openly into the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision taken by means of funding for the running budget has already been decided in the past autumn , by means of subsidies . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; according to T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a common room would be able to cope with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect one does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the statement that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the environment - as well as the roof @-@ roof - would be possible for the construction of the bags and making the construction more economical . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried sole believes , be this addition . &quot;
&quot; if it helps , he passes the body unanim@@ ously . &quot;
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which one does not get so much forward , but one now lean into the common room out of the window , says : &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is really talking about the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no supplement , but I get a real counter@@ f@@ eit in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal to split the proposed resolution , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; if we grasp the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : cyclists are hur@@ led on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and badly injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police shared , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bicycle on the bicycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from direction Hil@@ den . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road@@ way in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
&quot; a passenger car driver , driving in the same direction , gave him priority . &quot;
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went to the road , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the traffic . &quot;
he met a car that headed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the road .
he suffered severe injuries and was transferred to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch .
FC Bayern Munich doesn &apos;t have to do without Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to let the game play against Dortmund .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup competition against the Cup winner .
&quot; in addition to the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the sta@@ ff@@ ing staff at the German football @-@ record champion Bayern Munich gets bigger and bigger at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
&quot; in du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B , coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without David Al@@ aba . &quot;
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; the Mun@@ ch@@ ins Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory match of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
wandering in the resin of star to star
&quot; in the resin , the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; should arise . &quot;
&quot; this is what the &quot; &quot; Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; is planning for . &quot;
there is a planet of planets in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star@@ Path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information by many visitors , it was called &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables is to be added via the Internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of the location . &quot;
accessibility was also a criterion .
&quot; later , the star@@ path train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it lies much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation I find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
the association has been operating the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye clearly can be seen .
&quot; since 2003 , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Plan@@ etary Planet@@ arium in Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to Ha@@ in@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to at the end@@ point , de@@ mot@@ ed to the d@@ warf planet - are placed exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , measuring 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the total distance of the planet is four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , it takes a good hour to reach the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
&quot; Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should face a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ fe@@ ather @-@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
&quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year , in order to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all the fans asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network offering the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he estimates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday combat . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous compli@@ ment to Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks , the three @-@ combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side is very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top comb@@ at@@ ants , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tyre fl@@ y@@ wheel
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about one hour , after that the traffic on the left @-@ hand lane was passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 at the start of the season , An@@ other Hoffmann hopes for the optimisation of the defense formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the first win of the season , with the result that the two opponents were not against Br@@ uns@@ wick at 2 : 2 . &quot;
&quot; they were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain is also to be optimised . &quot;
and the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to capture a gate after a throw @-@ off .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no one is facing the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain experience , as well as with the four chain . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just in the three chain at the half @-@ position in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we do not harmon@@ ize even better and we do not afford to make so many errors in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about a un@@ decided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I only judge the start of the season after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over au@@ e , only because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted early because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fres@@ her , as they could have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ladder @-@ favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to attend the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief Coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t , arrogan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience his players in no case on Sunday . &quot;
new results published by Swedish asylum seek@@ er application tests
recent results of asylum seekers in Sweden submitted to a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Ministry of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ shor@@ et ) has begun the tests last year .
they should make the assessment of the age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish immigration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the proper age of some refugees who were minor .
&quot; up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to trial cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may be &quot; &quot; under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results of the past months are steady . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we can &apos;t tell you , we shouldn &apos;t do that as if we could , &quot; &quot; he told the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of finding a child as an adult is minimal . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three sanitary bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a arch bridge made of concrete , cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead above Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side . &quot;
this is a marginal attachment that is also used as an operating path .
&quot; on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge board is to be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to be lost .
&quot; the special thing is that it deals with finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special touch of intuition has demanded the laying of leads through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected . &quot;
&quot; prior to the work , the local residents were informed about the project . &quot;
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the bus@@ stop in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely locked . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridges amounts to EUR 700@@ ,000 . &quot;
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with german potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull in one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krei@@ stag group ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D invites &quot; &quot; great election campaign &quot; &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those , who are on site for hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the well &apos;s square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the round@@ about - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ person of the Forum A World and one of the organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel reports that he has tried to get such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n first , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ er@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police had remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 clock . &quot;
the police can move back - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolfgang Pos@@ a uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli has been given in the series Has@@ lach &apos;s convent concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trumpet player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combines classical , jazz and free play to a fascinating overall artwork . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try it out , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of their &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin in relation to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine ass@@ ures : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone I &apos;ve been making . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked being taken seriously .
&quot; she especially suffered from &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in the school @-@ time when she rather dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and remember : &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to act in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and maybe some people call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration collap@@ sed in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I &apos;d say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party which would stop us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to resume sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , that the exile of his country was out of the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who have been cut off gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot days , and will do whatever is possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the world &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , which will start on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
tragedy ki@@ cked off in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , some 1,000 people of the two soldiers were thought about in a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained down@@ fall .
&quot; she described the two revers@@ ed pilots as &quot; &quot; benef@@ actors &quot; &quot; of their profession . &quot;
&quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from northern h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and taken on Thursday by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr , Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; roses laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operations of the helicopter @-@ helicopter Tiger at Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen , did not show that the deployment was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want grave beside his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that shared the royal house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also presented the title &quot; Prin@@ c@@ esses . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is ultimately to be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ crat , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always hel@@ pless , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk cra@@ mp@@ ons instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ ges that I smoked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation in this country to be the brand of critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; this was because on Friday , the parliament decided to dissolve parliament . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the surprise withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties from their state @-@ day parliamentary fraction in Lower Saxony has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country &apos;s elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; the former Green Party , El@@ ke T@@ ire , justified their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) . &quot;
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to take place on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable for the Land@@ tag to quickly resolve its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Land@@ tag of the Prime Minister withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; these opportunities must be legally checked , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; all questions will be discussed in peace , if they are legally assessed . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as an en@@ voy of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called upon the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land state .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she will give her land tag that she has received via the green Land List with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ire . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to take any pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in terms of content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
&quot; SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony Green Party , El@@ ke T@@ ester , to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the attitude of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly select the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politicians in their past vanity and fru@@ stration are their personal interests in the interests of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD general secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat political capital out of it . &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ life@@ jackets to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in parliament . &quot;
&quot; agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against greed , Mr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is talking and answering . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot;
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; in spite of this , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; as well as the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are transport @-@ capable and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if eggs of the residual oil content exceed 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not accessible . &quot;
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , production plants are not guilty of immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in the emergency . &quot;
is there only a lack of personal or coherent responsibility ?
it was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are present is of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and accessible food .
&quot; when an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ acted means that manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ susta@@ ining animals is not acceptable and must be immediately terminated . &quot;
&quot; on all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect all the competent authorities to inform the facts quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the F@@ oot &apos;s financial rules affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come from the UEF@@ A for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ takes and brings him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the power rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they must be subject to legitimate revenue sources , which allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their activities related to football . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to the surveillance of their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; even though Plat@@ ini fell in favour of the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to dis@@ courage excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the selling prices for the next five years amoun@@ ting to 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros can be reported in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues through businesses associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ arian company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar WC am@@ bass@@ adors will be am@@ bass@@ adors and that such manoeu@@ v@@ res for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , to observe any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing the people familiar with the situation on Thursday . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and trimm@@ ing . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the agreement .
the Spanish division was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because one can different paths or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced Swiss chocolate in recent years .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing its mission .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott has confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; every year , around 17 million small red @-@ white packed Scho@@ gg@@ le@@ af@@ eln will distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing on the passengers . &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a Scho@@ g@@ gi@@ manufacturer .
&quot; as many applicants will find in the new ten@@ dering procedure , Swiss Life does not want to disclose . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge period ( when the vision@@ ary David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd were going to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for promising lots of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the G@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids , who will grow up - they nevertheless managed to gain the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
there is another crazy vi@@ cious plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the exam courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons side@@ burns of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old min@@ er . &quot;
these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; whose final scene will show the band as it will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 80s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ bbed in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; with six long episodes , it moves away and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a smaller length , could better supply its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are always visiting the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything for for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Rum@@ anian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in sla@@ ying the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; in the process , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , officials ordered large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects , German arrest warran@@ ts were issued . &quot;
the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia is accused of organized drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office has been conducting Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bonds of the gang . &quot;
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreigners &quot; register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; partly serious wrong decisions &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in an analysis conducted by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the statistics , ten million people with foreign nationality are included in the register , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; from people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the Register any more . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data inputs can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also registered , who would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; such false orders , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with foreign countries , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children once they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to this , the paper says that the &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; re@@ direc@@ ts such procedures to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for achieving it first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country . &quot;
&quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send back refugees to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened because of short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system for un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in a total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people . &quot;
at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; Ju@@ er@@ gen Gre@@ il , who has now donated 50 litres of blood in his meanwhile 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation di@@ gni@@ fies the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , yet un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preserved foods are broken into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn @-@ makers reported on the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house had led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rels were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 years of donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many of them book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ mmer , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the de@@ bil@@ itating of inflation have damp@@ ened the speculation about an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members in this month striving to increase as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that in the coming years interest increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of bor@@ rowing would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus that was issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks starting next February , although it was said that now it will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the GDP ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice because the pressure on the real income of households remains bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than the markets are expecting . &quot;
markets are forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases were &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are projected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news of the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision for no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate rise , and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and marginal salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening is getting worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; the loss of income , but she added that the wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; can be rec@@ uper@@ ated &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which will offset a portion of lower consumer spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the fall of the spark . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rate rise has increased because inflation boo@@ sted pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that exceeding the ratio to its target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn in Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are silent looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages conclude , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
&quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; HIV @-@ prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court in front of the High Court in September . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ pre @-@ sexual pro@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health care via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; announced on Thursday , N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens was called an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ disposition pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduced HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas significantly .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable candidates are identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will award £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , specifically targeted for vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
&quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Ministry of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is now important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the end of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my former in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi of Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to resolve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend .
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work for longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ weight , so it gli@@ des very easily when you push the door . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor space and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something completely ast@@ ounding .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers struggle for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers have lived four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation over one of Victori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate imperialist worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be split . &quot;
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a store at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - written by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in owns assets amoun@@ ting to $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - Col@@ in , like Paul claims to have ruled it out . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in a competent manner . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ acy transactions from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ lade of the family .
Col@@ in says he began to work in West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid £ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul says &quot; over the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter . &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media took up contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
the new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news media , hoping to keep the chief on a more equ@@ itable course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees at his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House which he wanted to repair : bad information that has fallen into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry with unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ co . &quot;
&quot; at the time , Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; the key to control Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know about others - that tr@@ umps without their interventions would have included even more combus@@ tible material .
we will probably never know about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
&quot; if his employees managed to keep it away for a couple of times , then their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - devoted entirely to this story , reported in May on the preference of advis@@ ors to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump reading the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; gold @-@ makers added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , receiving the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still seek influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
&quot; in this summer , police all over Europe sends out virtual postcards to dangerous criminals . &quot;
&quot; since the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are not known to nature , information from the population will be hoped and requested . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action , which follows the winter &apos;s &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Christmas calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many cur@@ sory notes were hiding on holiday destinations , called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 postcards for the most sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been available , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online con@@ fessions have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined trav@@ eller on the base of the war , who have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their homes . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road by Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their incur@@ sions . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent back by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw rocks on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by Sch@@ am , since he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May and were moved back and are now back .
&quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instruction to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot stop it .
&quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling on 101 . &quot;
this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case .
&quot; from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise gets out of the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , company company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost due to the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council . &quot;
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he was to be right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with business director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you will be named Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , building sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do in March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot;
we want to make a piece of jewellery .
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and conference room are part of the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already on an elevated downtown level , Sch@@ erer under@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director of tourism Michael Kr@@ ause already led , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the city &apos;s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; asked about the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to pin@@ point exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor installations are also brought to the front @-@ man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us Special Off@@ ers Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the panel has resum@@ ed its work , and wrote the Wall Street Journal under the guidance of familiar people . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N reported that there were already initial invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between the Tr@@ ump @-@ oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; for some time now , US intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin to have specifically interfer@@ ed in the 2016 presidential election campaign . &quot;
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between the Com@@ mit campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the case of the investigations , several men were to stand who acted as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans during the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more tr@@ umps in a private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special agent Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accus@@ ation as to whether the president may have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the evidence in potential crime cases and to decide whether to raise charges .
&quot; Grand Jury , therefore , are also called the Prosec@@ ution . &quot;
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the board can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to invite people to interro@@ gate under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
the report was called upon by persons involved in the meeting .
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the conversation . &quot;
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the sub@@ stitution show that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary he wants to act quickly .
&quot; however , it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would end up being turned on to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the release of the council is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign against his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
the subject gives the democr@@ ats a possibility to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about .
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he didn &apos;t know about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; but I usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House supports any measures aimed at acceler@@ ating the work of the special agent in a fair way .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey has said three times that not against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in that statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been loud , he has obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June Com@@ ey , in front of a Senate Committee , asked Tr@@ ump to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his staff . &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was sack@@ ed .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the former President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired on the margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators set out the bill on Thursday before the Special Off@@ ers could not be dismissed .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg flo@@ ats in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ cti@@ ca , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has become detached from the ice shelf . &quot;
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research shared this on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , which weighs heavily over 1 tri@@ l@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it has melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t get a danger to people .
&quot; according to researchers , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken @-@ off col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ ho@@ e so far .
hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
&quot; North of this flock of ice , the balance between wa@@ xing and ab@@ ort was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete cow@@ ardi@@ ce .
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is in danger , as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it results after melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf causes glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , albeit to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI information , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most widespread withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; he too acknowledged . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not lead the abor@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ dogs of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past decades . &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the last 50 years and t@@ ame it to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employer &apos;s association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Krei@@ stag party broke out 41 new positions in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them . &quot;
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very popular .
there were around 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be distributed this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann circle . &quot;
&quot; among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
&quot; together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that one did not know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a down@@ right &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease @-@ related or age @-@ related reasons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is time to act so that more jobs will not remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint proposal with his party . &quot;
he had long since taken care of a rotten surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and amazed the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow ex@@ iting from the communal employer .
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better for employees and function@@ aries than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are available only when one changes to a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself in professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act . &quot;
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of the Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew effectively worked with men &apos;s traders in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself in extensive alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which will be delivered directly from human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can sail so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a have to have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti stated that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan may@@ ors during this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern pf@@ alz , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ ages market .
&quot; again , the view point reached the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flying &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and lod@@ ges brought welcome p@@ auses . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
&quot; Neu@@ stadt , too , was also controlled . &quot;
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga is equi@@ pping itself for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through weather and weather over the stadium ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high amounts are included . &quot;
&quot; the first federal li@@ ga@@ des , who are increasingly involved in this field , have also recognised this . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that a number of clubs are coming up on this train .
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup organised the first Inter@@ active Club World Cup in London , where the Gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer any markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Federal Government to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just FIFA World Cup simulation will be fo@@ stered at a competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many people the idea is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in the classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tic understanding and a fast reaction capability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls were difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; players are on an international scale , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; that is little , against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot;
many countries are already on the rise .
&quot; major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are taking part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting supplier Uni@@ ver@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ös . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clear the old times is not enough today .
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
you can &apos;t hold on to the fact that only football remains as it always was .

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to commit suicide due to the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , the father of Roy said at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they depl@@ ore .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz however , he did not find out that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor called a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not enter the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pains that we will bear with us for eternity , for his sisters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call for another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many aven@@ ues , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is switch on the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
Ju@@ dge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was paid by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was convic@@ ted of murder by her British mate in Italy in 2007 before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ olo : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
it is no coincidence that Joshua Kim@@ olo was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup .
the FC Bayern di@@ gests a great season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , that looked at Joshua Kim@@ olo instantly , even though the additional garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the tie at his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; he told the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the objection would have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ i was also able to interpret the character of the coach .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f as a player in the youth player , de@@ but@@ ant and just out of the vacation , but he . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those with a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in a good mood .
&quot; for those who have been chosen to inher@@ it the inheritance of Lah@@ m , a little extra motivation can only be used well . &quot;
Kim@@ ber@@ y confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sli@@ t into the field as a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is now its position , the white bonds on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ olos appeared in this initial formation like the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand , too . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to steer the un@@ rehear@@ sed trou@@ pe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were dealing with himself .
&quot; Vi@@ dal is doing his missing fitness ( barely folding ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t not neg@@ atively impact . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ ber , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm frequently did a lot of trouble , and Sü@@ le also tried a couple of times in the construction of the game . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance at the debut .
&quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said good @-@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ la Tempo
&quot; the relationship between the country and the regional economy was often in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ent , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is shown after more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sig ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region respond to T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time ad@@ minist@@ ering the old prime minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
&quot; the biggest about @-@ turn , of course , is the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to stand . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the western part of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , &quot; says Ministry spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier stri@@ ves , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , in wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports over ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sig has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the Chamber of Industry commen@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the new Master bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master test and 2500 Euros , if graduates learn independently within ten years of master education . &quot;
but the home@@ work schedule for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , at the same time missing the country by the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the I@@ HK of Trier . &quot;
&quot; until now , only 29 jobs have been vac@@ ated by 56 new engineers who wish to employ Wis@@ sing for mobility abroad . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , sober@@ ing is the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private University in Karlsruhe , where after four months , they were once again admitted to the field because of dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; Audi is expected to change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chairman said the company believes that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options for driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is located - prohi@@ bit or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announces on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European car manufacturers strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases generated by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competi@@ tively . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of disgu@@ ising the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called laun@@ chers , which could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations on Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system in order to avoid emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the test could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft is driving through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big information saver .
it shows a mil@@ ler mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True Love , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is intended to shar@@ pen the wild river . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the no@@ stri@@ ls of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ ans are still working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh , because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he tou@@ red among other things as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for lucky cards - which fru@@ strated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figur@@ ines are floating in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ l@@ ly figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters . &quot;
the main person in the movie Cra@@ zy Island is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los is the most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that is supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence at risk of climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions of drought and due to diseases , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , are causing great headache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in the spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has an impact on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small zi@@ cade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing evap@@ oration from soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to drought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings reach . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of being on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while throughout the country the bodies accumulate , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , journalists are rarely brought to court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is still tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez leav@@ ed the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he just managed to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced from his car and fired 12 times on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter travelled in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the road every day or that the cemetery is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug roy@@ alty , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was bl@@ amed for not protecting his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed aisle users bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story .
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues on the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without hitting the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you must take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ? why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could cur@@ l like a do@@ ck@@ workers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their embarrass@@ ing run@@ ways and run@@ ways to get drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , the editor of the odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said , &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happens with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; days earlier , it became known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen tried shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who the governor was not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape , where the gangs of drugs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for this week &apos;s edition , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has printed on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on the state expendi@@ tures that concentrated on the city &apos;s home town .
&quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , carried out a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , belonging to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the whole century all the political planes . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ profile cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; we used to know what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few notes and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez acc@@ using the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has asked since then that she is re@@ group@@ ed by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; media group assigned more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was said to have been signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ sets were placed next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to h@@ um . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the bathing place Maz@@ at@@ lan had left ninet@@ een confirmed dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ l nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the streets . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one . &quot;
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it was so well received that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of a &quot; uns@@ ett@@ led past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the be@@ ster@@ ly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot;
the Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ r that lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has surprised researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground cl@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ protection , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed him to better ming@@ le in his surroundings and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered counter sh@@ ading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs are hun@@ ted by eating enough pressure through car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oured the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life , including his ser@@ rated Dar@@ by content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and moved out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fle@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the King of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six @-@ ton@@ ne heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is sun@@ k after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the reserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept away by Western Canada until an over@@ flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the water equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ me cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilometres @-@ long stalls - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information of the police , around 17@@ .00 h between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were close to 30 vehicles during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ tw@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; at first , there was no indication of the exact number of injured parties . &quot;
&quot; it was a light up to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large number of emergency vehicles were charged at the accident scene .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
a ten @-@ kilometre @-@ long back@@ log was formed in the direction of the city of Munich .
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also massive obstruc@@ tions on the return journey - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire department noted the characteristics of the car drivers , which now have to be expected with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you don &apos;t feel uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ted or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and vali@@ dates the ticket .
&quot; at present , a test run operates on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available at many other distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without conductor .
&quot; to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway .
&quot; it also has to be purchased through the app of the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you need a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
&quot; if the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspections by our train crew , the DB Navig@@ ator simply checks for yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , the Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who travel often know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest obstacles . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the co @-@ drivers not all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to present .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large @-@ room and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen trains .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question , &quot; &quot; Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and there would remain four hours there .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; thought Ferr@@ ell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put off her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ et about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be the father of Brow@@ ns who signed a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; she remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 11@@ pm , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ uson , is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the human view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Ferr@@ ell and her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ uson , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; over the black experience and the black state &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ uson because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; she said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to get rid of ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the fortune to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep them away .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Ferr@@ ell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell .
&quot; after 9 August , my activ@@ ism totally changed , &quot; she said , notic@@ ing that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Ferr@@ ell : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson did not centr@@ alize their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his engagement brought Ferr@@ ell closer together , along with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years of Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because that &apos;s how I &apos;m going to be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 influenced the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was chosen because of its identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago .
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while some say one to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Kamp@@ ysts ) , or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city , from which the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct will be bleeding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the plot , where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will be finished . &quot;
&quot; the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in terms of Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Sim@@ one Rooms : &quot; we have been buying weekly in the farmers market hall for many years now .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady again and again gladly . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is that too .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery will depend on the amount of the rent .
but the new project should probably not be very low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what a shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; be it clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but as there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; what a pity , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where is the peasant market hall supposed to be during the construction period ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - also in the long run , when the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming . &quot;
or does the spec@@ tre bit gallery manage to exp@@ el all the stores from Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; that won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my view it would have been better to have a real peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg , there is no place for a peasant market hall any more . &quot;
&quot; once the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after making public diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ former and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg &apos;s algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from man@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only for the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum pa@@ w - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in it , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she couldn &apos;t be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ efs , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic book &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ose Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ ees a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform the judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of lucky coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; which was based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a jack of thousands of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with us is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears in a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of the United States Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ inary In@@ dic@@ ators , such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they put your speech in cold , then they won , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
&quot; a nation @-@ wide chase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford , who are searched as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the files of the District Court of Cook County show .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Office says that the body was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives insp@@ ect the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. cub@@ icle , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now in a state of absence and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said cub@@ icle . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokesperson at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
security cameras confirm that both La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to respect the code , describing the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not conc@@ ede anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ oh &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing scandal of the WA@@ DA on the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
it was however allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organization in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell any eggs for the time being
this divided the groups of companies .
&quot; it was a purely precau@@ tionary measure , and it could not be assumed that any health distur@@ b@@ ance could be assumed , it was said in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on the fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ fem@@ oral pattern . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency among his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next user
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if anonym@@ ity was promised , some workers did not dare the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to offer surveys , provide specialist groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and appeal hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ stle blo@@ wers allow the C @-@ Suite executives to b@@ ypass and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit to track your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the snap @-@ ups and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results so that you can re @-@ drill why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture you have to stay , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line to report bad behavior to employees .
&quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has seized the regulator , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships - are identified and addressed more quickly . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed because of ethical bre@@ aches by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ic , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges to use their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; S@@ apphire VC received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising funds raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; at $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , gl@@ itz@@ ers secured his total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments . &quot;
the employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard , and that the work you do is worth it , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which used both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors gain returns when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools promise third parties , increase commitment and employee engagement , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 requests , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies too much reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not going to follow , staff ask yourself , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now surveys monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , says Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after gathering feedback from fru@@ strated workers , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you too lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s about 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour practice before returning to the Aqu@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 a.@@ m .
&quot; this is a true treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 a.m. to meet the already packed time schedules of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
twenty years before the start of formal preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s regime change even if they add another dot to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they plum@@ met@@ ed on , they &apos;re great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been cleared with foot@@ balls that scra@@ ped a safety net behind a gate post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook seeks to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit news from third parties and then show their results under the original article then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to facts sur@@ vey@@ ors , which may indicate possible outcomes of the fact check from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French elec@@ torate being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly remove hate @-@ filled posts like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories of fact sur@@ vey@@ ors are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were itself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , studying the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ ha@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who had something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go their way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a recording of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps they are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons who hid the Dar@@ r@@ ell family for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell depic@@ ts his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always doing debts and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writers &quot; experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle clo@@ aks in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the litter of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret around Nelson Ar@@ tz . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they compete with other municipalities . &quot;
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ figure five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) will advise on retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the head of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the meetings . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians were in the number of Y@@ AS . &quot;
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the leader of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been involved in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ comfortable in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ban on the head of soldiers for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale teaching in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan issued another 7@@ 3@@ 95 govern@@ ors , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
&quot; three times , they were calling for their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan re@@ pressed the power of the military step by step , not least relying on the reform agenda of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives specifically on the Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , seeking asylum in foreign countries after the coup attempt , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , NATO could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after cleansing doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weakened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to reduce the legal Immig@@ rants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do this by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are issued green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race safety shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the racing ticket has been denied - now it is supposed to be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the railway line , on which the tourist train runs , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race track system in the long term , construction work will begin at the circuit according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly important for tourism , &quot; explained the state secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the repair was estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned agreement between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the racing board shuttle should be regularly ordered in December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation in the past few months , it has been tested whether the range is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is very b@@ ump@@ y in parts . &quot;
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre@@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they substitute real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape if one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one the most . &quot;
&quot; on its website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ies ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
but what is si@@ ck@@ ering out of the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened globally in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women . &quot;
&quot; the most dis@@ su@@ asive aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowing body and the out @-@ of @-@ eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are slave slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the saying of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of human mind
&quot; it has become a tr@@ ump wisdom of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives . &quot;
we are all going to strain all of us to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power tr@@ umps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which they strug@@ gled for decades for politics , suddenly and quite stran@@ gely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will not be rep@@ ul@@ sed one day . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself trapped by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cre@@ dul@@ ous and the animals twist in order to look full of fear over their own shoulders , extremely dark and the cli@@ pping music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream . &quot;
thirty @-@ five years later and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience , as two years old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ ies can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score but fortunately nobody asked him . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no one is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zing gr@@ inning while I &apos;m tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was hospit@@ alized because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ ader , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
&quot; when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg , &quot;
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ area wat@@ chers from F@@ oot and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were fired into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; in future , three of the students go to secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte greeted parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical entitled &quot; The Eagle in the chickens . &quot; &quot;
&quot; peasant Arnold found a strange egg , and he let it out of his chickens . &quot;
instead of a chicken leg a little eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of making him a chicken , sh@@ attered himself , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , carrying the cylinders in order to win the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young animal may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ leg@@ ged man to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; thank you to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps into teaching pas@@ sports and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the time of the cu@@ cum@@ ber was over , she explained the class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher . &quot;
she left her students very reluct@@ ant after two years because it was a really great time .
&quot; finally , they have been able to rely on the four @-@ wat@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
eight original people are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal camp people in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and impose substantial fine fin@@ es to anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose .
the controls will be continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars of the E@@ TS 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
&quot; Anja S@@ met@@ anin , of the ACE car Club Europe , offers assessments : &quot;
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt ( German ) Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced their spe@@ edy implementation over the next few months , but they have not yet made an exact date . &quot;
Daimler advised to write to each person concerned .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework . &quot;
how long will the conver@@ sions go on in general ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would consider , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a threat of a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
&quot; in rural areas , there have been no loss of value for older diesel so far . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump is promising to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the prestigious awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored . &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .

we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; the job is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker is a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application can fulfill the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; thus , considering the regular notice periods , there should be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub @-@ law office for the administrative community , the applicant must instruc@@ t the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but citizen &apos;s proximity to the city and itself is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in ministry , a number of significant projects have been collected , looking back on W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the parking lot of Nieder@@ ho@@ fen have been initiated .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in design , there is a lot of room for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ la@@ ken &apos;s own Bau@@ hof and G@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei , it is possible to react very flexibly to much of it . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green areas is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a historic monument , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ cher@@ y bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; in support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere but also for the further development of the city .
&quot; according to the city of Has@@ lach , who would like to have buried Roland W@@ acker , should present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor with a field of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) supports civil engineering and civil engineering , urban planning , urban planning , urban gar@@ dening and urban gar@@ dening , as well as sub@@ urban civil protection authority including monument protection . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : South Railway Line closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle on the lines of the railroad tracks in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; near the crime scene , a pink sk@@ ier and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond the borders of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have put himself in danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ oti@@ ves and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of the rail passenger transport , even pat@@ rons of the railway customers could come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; on the whole , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum was to be expected , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern rail track could be carried out without obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; almost ten passenger flights had dropped Friday morning , two of which were concerned about the long distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; goods did not fall out , but they delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study confirms the exact opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system .
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result . &quot;
experiments have shown that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i , which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a nutrition tolerant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher , Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , investigated a kind of immune cell that fo@@ stered tolerance , when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was accommod@@ ated separately did not have this . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they did not have an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grew in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ating cells as mice and that most of us are protecting L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot;
&quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that the mid@@ fiel@@ der made his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ und signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday and impressed the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched forward . &quot;
&quot; however , matic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the premi@@ er league season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u took part in Avi@@ va &apos;s stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made three more new commitments , but insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority obligations . &quot;
&quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have done great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertisement in the past .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing Logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turned out , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only a bon@@ fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the League , was the most important wish of the electoral warri@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , the fundamental change has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been watching the events in the SPD @-@ ruled provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with a head@@ wind in the approach . &quot;
there were deep ra@@ inf@@ all .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber on the German editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , who was start@@ led by the surprise , over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the country &apos;s elections , his red @-@ green coalition finally lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; the Green Party executive , Michael Kell@@ ner , asked El@@ ke T@@ ire to return her mandate to the back@@ sliding Dutch Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ ire . &quot;
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jacket must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign coordinator of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ ghs when on Friday morning , the new hi@@ de@@ an embassy reached the party &apos;s headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the president of the SPD of Lower Saxony , stands after the accession of the Green Members of El@@ ke T@@ essin to the CD@@ U without their own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , was re@@ ass@@ uring by the comrades at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
so it was - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to war , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te pushed the party smooth . &quot;
the comrades scra@@ ped again in the weeks after that .
&quot; then , when they had just started new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ top reached Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Gover@@ nor of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus during the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he did pretty much wrong about what one can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
&quot; so , even Stephan Wei@@ l . &quot;
&quot; because of the VW exhaust system and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony prime minister has been in criticism for some time now . &quot;
some survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him go because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony @-@ based Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; for the time being , comrades strive to keep their ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ ess T@@ life@@ jackets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ ati@@ zing how wife T@@ ire puts their own career decisions on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; woman T@@ ire has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her personality , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the willingness to vote four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony ( SPD ) candidate into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for the core of the city III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development informed on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a look back to what has happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been feelings of re@@ development . &quot;
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the area of refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is important to also promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum of the funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros come from the country , the rest of the commun@@ e . &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , according to Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .
&quot; if necessary , the area borders could be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; Con@@ federation programme in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; since 1 January 2017 , the grant period for funding runs until 30 April 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out once again in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , it is planned to take place as soon as possible , so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that each commun@@ e had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations . &quot;
it is about evaluating the urban conditions of the city and deciding when it will be renovated and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective property , there will also be a remedi@@ ation note in the land register . &quot;
&quot; again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and take a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
this is why questionna@@ ires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; , &quot; in which it is possible , among other things , to the structural condition and the renovation intentions . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and apartment sheet , &quot; information on size , layout and residents of a residential space can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new building measures are not eligible for funding . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphasized that the distribution of the funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - whoever comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first . &quot;
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British inventor himself sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an expert an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights US manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military personnel left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence , and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was placed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military bure@@ au of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , his super@@ visor , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news indicates that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7@@ am for the event , and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
&quot; the note also adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second crew was needed . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states using state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the purpose .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked up , &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for travel .
but your use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet landed in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often conduct training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn to put down the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted on the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
unit records list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for the reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga joins the S@@ V in the third row .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League Bundes@@ liga has gotten the sense of reality . &quot;
&quot; at any rate , Team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent . &quot;
&quot; this is a compact team , always playing in a quite similar formation . &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to st@@ akes in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ k ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is always difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good dose of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; the Fren@@ ch@@ man , who is currently active at the chall@@ enger tournament in Bi@@ ella , won &apos;t play the Bundes@@ liga match at the moment . Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is playing at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec for his first use in this season . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo , yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski , was on the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot;
&quot; he should be present in Kiel but as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ deb@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking list in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ re from the trainer &apos;s staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his prison , to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress submitted a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he estimated . &quot;
&quot; Moscow &apos;s reaction was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels boo@@ sted the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the plan envis@@ ages to punish European companies who help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the O@@ MV are al@@ armed . together with other European companies , the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 has been co @-@ financed . &quot;
the dr@@ one is enormous .
&quot; however , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to impose sanctions on an executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen , which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ co &apos;s season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the hit@@ series by Net@@ fli@@ x &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ co , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the world &apos;s rich@@ est drug trade organization : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as &quot; Fort@@ une 500 enterprises &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry C@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ co will begin on 1 September .
role Re@@ wards : the town provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and delivers fresh cooked cooled .
&quot; the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last Kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children , who are cared for by 45 week@@ days , eat at the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz explains . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have a kitchen service starting September 1 : they heat the delivered foods , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , portions the meal individually , give off , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen workers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more integrated and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical solution for the city in comparison to the cost comparison between the owner &apos;s own and the outside allocation for the city . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong for around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative when all the members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , official head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will run in the provinces in the council elections . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process .
the elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over peaceful by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by registered 3.@@ 6 million voters .

men trying to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police information , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to talk to the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to grab the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed . &quot;
&quot; without loo@@ t , the duo fled . &quot;
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to as@@ certain Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glas@@ gow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant that produces apart from other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; &quot; express concern &quot; &quot; that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain any clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Glas@@ gow metrop@@ olitan area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the prospect of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glas@@ gow is ur@@ ging a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the director at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react immediately as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e economic climate , we continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and fully . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La league may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar following an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release cl@@ auses , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the record of the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans level insi@@ sts that the club always has its best to take care of it since its arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the start of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; during the night of Friday on Saturday an unknown perpetr@@ ator has intentionally turned down a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 , and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle damage is caused by more than 200 euros . &quot;

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ted the guard at that time . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the road to Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to do@@ dge to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the crash barriers . &quot;
tangible damage was created on the passenger car .
&quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident victims , it can be good that the driver did not notice the accident at all . &quot;

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report &quot; &quot; reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report on the abuse of abuse is reli@@ eved by Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann believes .
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ die , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , expecting from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would very well serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the events at that time . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Vatican magazine &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that when reporting on violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , it was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the violations in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion about it , &quot; says Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also spoke with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk in an interview : &quot; we like to go to the church , and this is a found feeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; to cope with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the memory book &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; says E@@ zek@@ iel , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is written in the 440 pages report , which was presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber of the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be even more violent . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , however , many cas@@ u@@ alties have been estimated that many victims rated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as chol@@ er@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you do the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
&quot; he has just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside its sphere of influence .
you can at best prevent him from getting out of it too late or not having taken first hints seriously enough .
&quot; the gym@@ nasi@@ um in which he worked was felt by practically all sur@@ vey@@ ors - literally - &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is how the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger provide an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly provided the boys with cakes , biscuits and can@@ dies and &quot; always been en@@ camp@@ ed by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority is compla@@ ining about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional appeal , which also led to qu@@ arri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also condemned ear @-@ cow@@ ard@@ ly and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself had already admitted many years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the period between the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you know these methods of cultivation ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced that in a secular school , a state grammar school . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to what actually is in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; one wonders whether it is not with his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media fell on him straight . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , the report reported a great deal on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also accused of any involvement or co @-@ knowing with regard to sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : definitely not .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have become familiar with the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said an affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims remain silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally to a certain extent . &quot;
how do the R@@ atz@@ inger R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in relation to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student expressed this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that reck@@ oned with him ... be@@ ards are intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; that the pupils and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any shared responsibility . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be bl@@ amed for not preventing or displaying it . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , there was a lot of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of being &quot; &quot; Weg@@ g@@ ating &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed and mixed up in the reporting became a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but that is precisely what , in turn , is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; in fact , there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and abuse of violence as well as , let us say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report treats incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral director of the Cathedral Spar@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly victi@@ mi@@ zed and mal@@ igned and suffered from them , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral @-@ spar@@ ing gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most witnesses stress , the subject &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool , &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
we were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ cal &quot; conditions .
what was different at the dome gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power . &quot;
&quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported to him by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school at which he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger read his ears consistently before the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Gymnasium , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that &quot; in the pre @-@ school , the punishment would continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pen@@ alties in Bavaria had long been banned . &quot;
&quot; before that , they acquired themselves in a legal grey area , as each one of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have been exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the corpor@@ al punishment in schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis stated , that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past in accordance with today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess was right there .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times , and also not for what was f@@ aded in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all really horrible and I am glad that it will finally work out .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s , his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so as to draw ear @-@ fi@@ gs and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was banned , he was strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger read in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject test sentence also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all hide that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world @-@ tran@@ ce institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with biscuits and can@@ dies one does not once again make a great singer and a success , no matter what field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , ground@@ breaking , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , of whom one could not imagine that he could only do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his res@@ ett@@ lement , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly among them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is grateful to him that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up today and worship them down@@ right . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clear : all that you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long over@@ came this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the lawyer would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally leaving in peace . &quot;
