<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel to be dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everyone who had to get excited, because the car navigation system was a green meadow instead of a bypass road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but actual - but very informative."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a carpet of flickering that one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large picture postcard was incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called" "judgements". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian surveying administration, these arose between 1810 and 1864 and emerged from the first survey of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon ordered an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, they were the current neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map."</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV furthered the project and founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The judgment sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of former / today is most impressive, for example, the state capital."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called" "primeval recording" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are small plots there today no more farmers - but farmers of the" "land in the sun" "plant."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar gives the historical map an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment sheet, in the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "on the Gasteig" "or" "On the air" "- but also in big letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once closed people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich-based Irrenanstalt" On the Auer Ventilation "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was the head of the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of so-called Irish."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he forbids the personnel to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum of Haidhausen, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first place, later extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the power plant in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at the Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the football field of the TSV Munich East is located west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrigor, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "Main Square" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once standing at the Marienhof, where these days will work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line will take place."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen's Rights Group publishes Travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association for Farming has issued a warning for coloured people, who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racial attacks."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is supposed to come into effect until August 28, 2017, demands special attention to African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, since a number of questionable racce-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," "says the group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state who are disproportionately targeting minorities, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, which happen to people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip and was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney Office showing that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring any deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report of the FBI, which classify the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following immigration laws passed by local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further race benefit according to ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidefence Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac created a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"in the right-wing-graveyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherman's CDU location met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Schwarzwaldmilch "is the alternative marketing route for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferienges exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" essential. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area is a lot of work, and much has to be done with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not conduct biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the municipality has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader's funding. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forested up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost amounting to 71 500 euros, half of them were driven by leaders, one quarter bore the community of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmer remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers or farm women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss, it was clear:" the best food is produced here. ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The County Policies (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will enable the state to promote pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the area to be fenced off may not be tortuable (inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fishermen's Fishership Project 2018, eight participants with 24 plots, who would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are over 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the company's square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-hedgers would have killed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked its importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to it, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete story here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your idleness, your poor, your afflicted masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elending waste" on our screens was better to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture ought to show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a classic bilingual depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist clip and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to switch it back for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch will not light up the road to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh came across something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often horrible voyages on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch will not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers at a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the UK's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which kicks off on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special developed in Scotland" "and the athletics of the UK must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchers, who will compete against Sir Mon Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads on this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that you should observe after a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships when the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics about Facebook: don't mess around a public office if you cannot tolerate burning voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shrank in the criticism, for sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"because in 1783, Washington declared:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union complained this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "many people said."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever in using Facebook as the primary means of combining himself with his constituents and playing his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not like this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the Governor referred to as" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking one critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter recorders suggested his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">"and even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls."</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trading and shipping with Britain, asserted his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online paper of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silently silence her.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="233">"to this end, scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are in a study."</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking in 167," said Dr. Heiko Becher. "</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994."</seg>

<seg id="248">"when Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she doesn't use a stove."</seg>
<seg id="249">She rarely uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="250">"in its wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai rule in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally places a sweet potato - locally called" nota "- directly in the fireplace."</seg>
<seg id="251">"after half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands."</seg>
<seg id="252">"Degei sits on the loam floor - she has no furniture, where she also performs her daily work, e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp."</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless place serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">"as the youngest of the four wives of her husband, you have not been assigned fields."</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course, late work can be dangerous: most of the villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public lift in front of the occupying forces."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up independence from the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, where the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassed the eastern part of the island."</seg>
<seg id="261">"the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a morning 5-hour drive by car."</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transportation.</seg>
<seg id="263">"the town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo-fences, and from corrugated iron roofs, which were transformed by rust into various yellowish-brown tones."</seg>

<seg id="269">"Indonesia is the poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children's mortality and literacy rates in Asia."</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesian Goldland.</seg>

<seg id="272">"in 2015 alone, Freeport mined the value of $3.1 billion in gold and copper."</seg>
<seg id="273">"in addition, Papua has valued timber resources worth $78 billion."</seg>
<seg id="274">"these riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence."</seg>
<seg id="275">"an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport local military and units paid nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in a single officer."</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">"according to activists, more than 500,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military."</seg>
<seg id="278">Masses in Papuas's tribal highland in the 1970 "s became part of the Asia-Human Rights Commission for genocide.</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims each week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="282">Bolts have increased because Papuas resources bring a stream of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="283">"the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi."</seg>

<seg id="292">"in fact, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowis's inauguration in October."</seg>
<seg id="293">"on December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas carols off a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle."</seg>

<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">"a child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was struck so severely that he fell into coma."</seg>
<seg id="299">"a few hours later, the building of the nearby governmental Commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day."</seg>
<seg id="300">"about 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice."</seg>
<seg id="301">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and introduced the Waita-Dance - in circles continuously and a birdsong imitating - from Papuas Mee Pago-tribe.</seg>

<seg id="303">"when the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers about an internal radio:" "if the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," "it says in an official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media."</seg>
<seg id="304">"Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home."</seg>

<seg id="314">"it's about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">"according to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured."</seg>
<seg id="316">The news about the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">"three weeks Jokovi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="318">"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="319">"in October 2016, Minister of Security Affairs, Wiranto, said that he will set out an extrajudicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="320">But the excuses began almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most injuries occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90's and at the beginning of the 2000-s.</seg>
<seg id="323">"the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be traversed," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="324">Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="325">"instead," everything is regulated by law, "he said."</seg>
<seg id="326">"Wiranto, accused by the UN for" crimes against humanity, "claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence referendum, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been included, including the Paniai incident."</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I was interviewed four times during the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes. "</seg>

<seg id="332">"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="333">His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.</seg>
<seg id="334">He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="335">"after I buried the corpses, the military sought me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="336">The shootings have not stopped.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">"during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, a person died and 17 others were injured, including children."</seg>
<seg id="339">"the man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="340">Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="342">But local people say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.</seg>

<seg id="344">"I hid myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai parliament called on the officers to take account of the officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always a cause of trouble for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>
<seg id="348">"many joined the" Free State of Papua "(OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of Papua by increasing sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="349">"some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai, under the pretext of" safeguarding national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never dive again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty boosts discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is also out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"in the course of time, economic inequalities between the indigenous peoples of Papua and the new migrants have grown, since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire has reached greater numbers."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and affluent migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for here there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai. "</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's campaign to raise the limits of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West-Iran: visa denial and a black list," "he said in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua (including Paniai)."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights.

<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"when an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited their silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but would remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they will probably not vote for Jokowi again."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowai is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokovi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor education and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua people, consider their voice for Jokowai as a" "guilt" "that he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite threats and intimidation, Paniai families carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that perhaps justice will never come to them, but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes."</seg>
<seg id="382">"a member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus with lowered head. "</seg>

<seg id="409">"the survey carried out over 1,000 people - the one of a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., was conducted - also noted that younger travellers were more likely to disregard the rules."</seg>
<seg id="410">"from those surveyed who admitted they knowingly attempted to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials were compared to less than 15 percent, which were members of Generation X."</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">"more than 3 percent claimed to have wittingly carried objects with clinchers through security control, while 2.2 percent of the female surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male surveyed also confirmed they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had brought about by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.</seg>

<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever-triumphant figures for turnover increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk will reveal another, less glittering number for the first time on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: most of the cancellations in the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk has frequently promoted over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins."</seg>
<seg id="425">"now, Musk admits that from the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn."</seg>

<seg id="430">"its argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side."</seg>
<seg id="431">"last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles."</seg>

<seg id="443">"it is about a deadline, which expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-borne ozone."</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt reported in June that he would delay adherence to a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or impede economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulation to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal advice for the Pruination regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen am invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius farm is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building on the site have made friends and supporters of Tumlingens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württemberg Register of Urs: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tumlingen along with the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document, on the hill of the Tumlinger hill, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court, to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the beautiful village centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating from the period around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was derived from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied himself with a parish priest remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"as a result, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones were shattered by Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later in the Second World War it had to be released in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), window panes were inserted and the bell pieces were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French forces encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">"they removed the pulpit and the church chairs, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger's Hilarius Cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was built.</seg>
<seg id="490">"during the New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the church steeple and half plunged."</seg>
<seg id="491">"in order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius system as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as organiser, the friends and supporters of Tumlingens invite on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is arranged by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"Hartmut Romann, the local leader, speaks the final word."</seg>
<seg id="497">The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to conclude the Serenade, there is a trunk in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade will take place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organisers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler."</seg>

<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only on the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city."</seg>

<seg id="511">"while the city Viersen had decided a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette, a few days earlier, the city Viersen had decided not to approve a second wind-force concentration zone - but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a formation error."</seg>

<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this equates to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-seater households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as an investment in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district."</seg>

<seg id="739">"the U.S. environmental protection authority has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration, which states that states are bound to curb the emissions-causing emissions. this took place one day after 15 states sued the agency because of the step."</seg>

<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are hovering such a common room not as a meeting place for the residents of the just-just living, but openly into the community."</seg>

<seg id="756">"the decision taken by means of funding for the running budget has already been decided in the past autumn, by means of subsidies."</seg>

<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is really talking about the common room - but absolutely against communal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the purchase of the surface there is no supplement, but I get a real counterfeit in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech."</seg>
<seg id="767">"Staigner's proposal to split the proposed resolution, finds three advocates."</seg>

<seg id="863">"they were two opponents too much, and we have to watch out better in aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>

<seg id="868">"still I don't know how to act in aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have just in the three chain at the half-position in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, who can build up well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we do not harmonize even better and we do not afford to make so many errors in the construction."</seg>

<seg id="875">"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight seasons," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over aue, only because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be aborted early because of a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season quasi with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be somewhat fresher, as they could have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ladder-favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know exactly where they are at the moment," says the inner defender of Fortuna. "</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be" "under 18 years of age." ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="998">"the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot days, and will do whatever is possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."</seg>
<seg id="999">CoE said he was "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to reuse Russia," Coe said. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar undertakes and brings him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the power rich ruling family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they must be subject to legitimate revenue sources, which allow them to break the break-even point in their activities related to football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to the surveillance of their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"even though Platini fell in favour of the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to discourage excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the selling prices for the next five years amounting to 44,4 million euros can be reported in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe penalties."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later lowered to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through businesses associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar WC ambassadors will be ambassadors and that such manoeuvres for UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.</seg>

<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish division was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going to see and she tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1159">Chocolat Frey board chocolate has produced Swiss chocolate in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1161">Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott has confirmed on request of the news agency sda a report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>

<seg id="1236">"in statistics of sufficient people, EU citizens are also registered, who would not have to leave."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"such false orders, however, led to a distorted debate on how to deal with foreign countries," it says in the analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government apparently began sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children once they arrived from there."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the debilitating of inflation have dampened the speculation about an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25%, with less members in this month striving to increase as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that in the coming years interest increases would be needed to curb the inflation of the Brexit and she said that the cost of borrowing would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mammoth economic stimulus that was issued one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks starting next February, although it was said that now it will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said:" "in the central forecast of the MPC, the GDP (GDP) remains weak at short notice because the pressure on the real income of households remains burdened by consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates, it reiterated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and" slightly greater "extent than the markets are expecting."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank emphasised that increases were" progressively "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts for this and next year are projected to be 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecast in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these news of the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision for no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations of interest rate rise, and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the latest inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and marginal salary increases, as the tightening is getting worse before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not" "prevent" "the loss of income, but she added that the wages for the end of their three-year forecast" "can be recuperated". ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to weak pounds, which will offset a portion of lower consumer spending."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the fall of the spark."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rate rise has increased because inflation boosted pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that exceeding the ratio to its target of 2% was "quite" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent downturn in Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are silent looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>

<seg id="1291">"patients will receive access to a" "transformative" "HIV-prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court in front of the High Court in September."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-pre-sexual propositional prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by health care via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">"announced on Thursday, NHS England chief Simon Stevens was called an" "important new intervention", "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Predisposition prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep reduced HIV transmission in infection-prone areas significantly.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable candidates are identified to agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will award £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive Officer at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, specifically targeted for vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"we warmly welcome this announcement." ""</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Ministry of Health, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"it is now important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV, and that they will contribute to the end of the dissemination of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my former in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the Architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work for longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the seating and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went inside," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweight, so it glides very easily when you push the door."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they succeeded in enlarging the floor space and at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>

<seg id="1355">Brothers struggle for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">"two brothers have lived four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation over one of Victorias's biggest real estate imperialist worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be split."</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a store at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now comprises offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - written by Paul as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin owns assets amounting to $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - Colin, like Paul claims to have ruled it out."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions in a competent manner."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicacy transactions from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeanslade of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began to work in Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis Group, whereby Colin claims that Mark was paid £10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were, so Paul says" over the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin held back very much though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took up contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current quarrel," "he said, adding that he is still hoping for a solution."</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">The new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media, hoping to keep the chief on a more equitable course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees at his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House which he wanted to repair: bad information that has fallen into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry with unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to be persuaded," "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite Polico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"at the time, Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote that" the key to control Trump's Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know about others - that trumps without their interventions would have included even more combustible material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees managed to keep it away for a couple of times, then their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - devoted entirely to this story, reported in May on the preference of advisors to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh" to be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump reading the article and started asking people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"gold-makers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, receiving the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">"from Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise"</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise gets out of the former hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof, company company ltd. on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost due to the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenhotels with business director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you will be named Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof, building shuttles have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still a lot to do in March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built-in."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "pretty bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself."</seg>
<seg id="1466">We want to make a piece of jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and conference room are part of the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbath, but already on an elevated downtown level, Scherer underlines."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"talks with OB Julian Osswald and director of tourism Michael Krause already led, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to pinpoint exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the outdoor installations are also brought to the front-man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, there is a large terrace, which is accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us Special Offers Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is said to have deployed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the panel has resumed its work, and wrote the Wall Street Journal under the guidance of familiar people."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN reported that there were already initial invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between the Trump-oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">"for some time now, US intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin to have specifically interfered in the 2016 presidential election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between the Commit campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the case of the investigations, several men were to stand who acted as advisors to the Republicans during the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also scrutinized more and more trumps in a private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the special agent Trump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accusation as to whether the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the evidence in potential crime cases and to decide whether to raise charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"Grand Jury, therefore, are also called the Prosecution."</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be turned on by the public prosecutor's office in order to invite people to interrogate under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">The report was called upon by persons involved in the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trump consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign chief Paul Manafort also participated in the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the substitution show that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would end up being turned on to decide on the charge of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the release of the council is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign against his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject gives the democrats a possibility to "feel good" because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he didn't know about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but I usually work in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House supports any measures aimed at accelerating the work of the special agent in a fair way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed in that statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump have been loud, he has obstructed the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June Comey, in front of a Senate Committee, asked Trump to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller was sacked.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of the Congress such as in the Watergate affair around the former President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired on the margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators set out the bill on Thursday before the Special Offers could not be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg floats in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctica, a giant iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has become detached from the ice shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research shared this on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, which weighs heavily over 1 trillion and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it has melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice-giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">He doesn't get a danger to people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of iceberg is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken-off colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelseshoe so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Horseshoe floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelseshoe is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this flock of ice, the balance between waxing and abort was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete cowardice.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelseshoe is in danger, as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate is under tension and can crumble if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it results after melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf causes glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, albeit to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI information, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"on the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most widespread withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he too acknowledged. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists, whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not lead the abortion of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-dogs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the last 50 years and tame it to the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU asks to step out of the employer's association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, the Kreistag party broke out 41 new positions in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very popular.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were around 620 applications for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann circle."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration."</seg>
<seg id="1560">"together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU wants to take the initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that one did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a downright "competition of the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who excrete disease-related or age-related reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"therefore, it is time to act so that more jobs will not remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint proposal with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long since taken care of a rotten surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and amazed the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow exiting from the communal employer.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a Haustarif," said peoples. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to pay better for employees and functionaries than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are available only when one changes to a higher level, which orientates itself in professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act."</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "Italy has warned NGOs to use the lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their crew effectively worked with men's traders in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself in extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a statement on social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that its crew will take dinghy migrants aboard, which will be delivered directly from human traffickers, and that smugglers can sail so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel laureate organisation is Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti stated that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors during this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine female bikers, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern pfalz, for four days to enjoy trials and sightseeings."</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there were again and again longer ascents, for which long trials were rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival sausages market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, the view point reached the lookout point, connected by" flying "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters were announced again."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and lodges brought welcome pauses."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled curative brine in the open-air inhalatorium."</seg>
<seg id="1610">"Neustadt, too, was also controlled."</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is equipping itself for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through weather and weather over the stadium?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, has become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high amounts are included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"the first federal ligades, who are increasingly involved in this field, have also recognised this."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">It is certain that a number of clubs are coming up on this train.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup organised the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the Gamers of various clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer any markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Federal Government to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or just FIFA World Cup simulation will be fostered at a competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, Ligen has long since established itself, in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many people the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in the classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactic understanding and a fast reaction capability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the custom player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobbing also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls were difficult to perform on online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on an international scale, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"that is little, against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is not far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte advisors. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are taking part in the US team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting supplier Univern.</seg>
<seg id="1649">A lot of things are happening in Europe too.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the soccer league clubs, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an e-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany lags behind," explains VfB-CEO Röttgermann. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was convicted in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"on Thursday, the father of Roy said at the hearing:" "my family is uncomforting."</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she took no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance which they deplore.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz however, he did not find out that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor called a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I do not enter the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, in spite of all my pains that we will bear with us for eternity, for his sisters." "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or would be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to call for another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, jump from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many avenues," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you need to do is switch on the generator, and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was paid by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox was convicted of murder by her British mate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1695">"well, the objection would have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>

<seg id="1698">Sugar is best distributed to those with a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in a good mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">"for those who have been chosen to inherit the inheritance of Lahm, a little extra motivation can only be used well."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimbery confirmed: "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old slit into the field as a Mini-Lahm."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"right behind, this is now its position, the white bonds on the arm did its rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all Kimolos appeared in this initial formation like the one who can take the rudder in his hand, too."</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions and tried to steer the unrehearsed troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had a look for the whole while many others were dealing with himself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal is doing his missing fitness (barely folding); Renato Sanches with it, on the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia trip (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with it, in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot not negatively impact."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked very well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süle ran beside Kimber, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli storm frequently did a lot of trouble, and Süle also tried a couple of times in the construction of the game."</seg>

<seg id="1715">Kimi said good-bye to his new fellow players after a few crunchy statements.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard an interesting proposition from Süle:" "what is going on here, I have already noticed."</seg>

<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to stand."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country also plays the western part of Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan."</seg>

<seg id="1759">"the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called launchers, which could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings reach."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no respite from violence, and while throughout the country the bodies accumulate, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists are rarely brought to court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is still treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez leaved the office of the newspaper Riodoce in Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he just managed to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced from his car and fired 12 times on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" Twelfth River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter travelled in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the road every day or that the cemetery is full of ornamented, two-story mausoleums for drug royalty, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was blamed for not protecting his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, presumed aisle users bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues on the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without hitting the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead? why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curl like a dockworkers, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their embarrassing runways and runways to get drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, the editor of the odoce Andres Villarreal said," "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days earlier, it became known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen tried shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, who the governor was not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the gangs of drugs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for this week's edition, Riodoce has printed on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on the state expenditures that concentrated on the city's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, carried out a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all the political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-profile cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped from a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few notes and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accusing the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has asked since then that she is regrouped by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book," Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the" Articulo 19 "media group assigned more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headsets were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title" What do you want of us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I was reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their telephones began to hum."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with rivals and security forces near the bathing place Mazatlan had left nineteen confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continues to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the edge of the board, they published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens howl nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if the same day when Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send them to the streets."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts described it as" "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs". ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even realize that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had had something of a "unsettled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the besterly armoured dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. ""</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved condition has surprised researchers who describe it as" "really remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy ground clump."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that these herbivores, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-protection, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed him to better mingle in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied wild animal and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered counter shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points out that the dinosaurs are hunted by eating enough pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life, including his serrated Darby content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and moved out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South Fleorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six-tonne heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta is sunk after death in the sea and mummified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the reserved armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the mored herbivores were swept away by Western Canada until an overflooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the water equipment of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautreme cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so 'rare as a win in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous injured, kilometres-long stalls - and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured during a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"according to the first information of the police, around 17.00 h between the connecting places Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) were close to 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm, among them probably also trucks, intertwined."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there was no indication of the exact number of injured parties."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was a light up to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of emergency vehicles were charged at the accident scene.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely locked in direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">A ten-kilometre-long backlog was formed in the direction of the city of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as reported by an AZ reporter, there was also massive obstructions on the return journey - through numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire department noted the characteristics of the car drivers, which now have to be expected with delicate penalties."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: you don't feel unsuspecting in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The conductor comes and wakes an unsanted or pulls the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and validates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"at present, a test run operates on two tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we will expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will probably be available at many other distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a railway spokesman. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the railway ticket devaluation without conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it also has to be purchased through the app of the train, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">"last but not least, you need a seat reservation."</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works like this: one gets into the train, calls his ticket under" My tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"in the test customers, a button for the electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep quiet."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train, which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspections by our train crew, the DB Navigator simply checks for yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, the Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who travel often know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"because often you have, in any case, one of the co-drivers not all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to present.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large-room and delays in controlling one's ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen trains.</seg>

<seg id="2021">"just one day after arriving in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a mail from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18 year old child, and it is still on the road," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed, they closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's lifeless body stretched out on the street and there would remain four hours there.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put off her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweet about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be the father of Browns who signed a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and cried," "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," she remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 11pm, she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the human view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had" "over the black experience and the black state" "countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "she said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to get rid of ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the fortune to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep them away.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"after 9 August, my activism totally changed," she said, noticing that she was a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, President of the Minority student Nurses Association, focusing on food and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community benefiting from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centralize their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestract inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his engagement brought Ferrell closer together, along with six other natives followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years of Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we're talking," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of Whose Streets show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 influenced the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen because of its identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian precinct has since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say one to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Kampysts), or" That's really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no man needs "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city, from which the rest of the business will benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct will be bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the plot, where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, it will be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in terms of Beda-Platz, with the possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying weekly in the farmers market hall for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady again and again gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is that too.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery will depend on the amount of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But the new project should probably not be very low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what a shopping list in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"be it clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but as there is not even a weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"what a pity, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where is the peasant market hall supposed to be during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - also in the long run, when the bit-gallery is actually coming."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the spectre bit gallery manage to expel all the stores from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "that won't work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view it would have been better to have a real peasant market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no place for a peasant market hall any more."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"once the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after making public diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg's algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from maning and created out of 30 portraits, like someone with these genomic data, has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only for the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum paw - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she couldn't be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal briefs, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic book" "Suppose Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresees a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform the judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually only few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of lucky coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, because Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces in order to find new, tweetable paths to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the" automatic fragmentation, "which was based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack of thousands of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with us is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as she appears in a hands-free phone in the hands of the United States Disciplinary Indicators, such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech in cold, then they won," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacons, which assemble like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also goal-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nation-wide chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford, who are searched as suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the files of the District Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died, 26, after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Office says that the body was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives inspect the stitches as murder while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. cubicle, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in a state of absence and excluded from entering the campus of the Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said cubicle."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesperson at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly urged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce", "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, which had just received a mysterious tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras confirm that both Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said. "</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants:" "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian vice-remier Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti-doping agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">"the PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to respect the code, describing the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the state-sponsored doping in Russian sports by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no state programs, and we will not concede anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutoh's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added. "</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal of the WADA on the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">It was however allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">"after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organization in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was" moving in the right direction "to be used again."</seg>

<seg id="2204">"Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"and even if anonymity was promised, some workers did not dare the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed. "</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to offer surveys, provide specialist groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and appeal hotlines, and in some cases whistle blowers allow the C-Suite executives to bypass and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the snap-ups and surveys by certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results so that you can re-drill why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture you have to stay, so that you will not be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisances in which those who have spoken have been punished."</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of Uber-Falles in Misskredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"cent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"like GLINT, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made" "pulse" "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline to report bad behavior to employees.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion has seized the regulator," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"in the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - are identified and addressed more quickly."</seg>

<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the Summer Courses will return to their final audits after the three hour practice before returning to the Aquman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a true treadmill for the guys the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 a.m. to meet the already packed time schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "he says melancholy."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>

<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") it seems all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, studying the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hushasey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks just started to take care of the archive that he described as" hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that represent who had something:" one could think that land conflicts would be boring, "Rhodes says," but there was a birch fighting for the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go their way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought that an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps they are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell depicts his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always doing debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men solved their school crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to advertise within."</seg>

<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the leader of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been involved in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt as a" gift of God, "as he gave him the opportunity to completely cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Uncomfortable in Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff, there are concerns about an increasing" Islamisation "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the ban on the head of soldiers for soldiers, wrote the paper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the large-scale teaching in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan issued another 7395 governors, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they were calling for their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan repressed the power of the military step by step, not least relying on the reform agenda of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan drives specifically on the Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>

<seg id="2388">"the rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried"</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford woman look progressively."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible," enthuses the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they substitute real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape if one goes a step towards Frigid (i.e.: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on its website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxies?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain tentatively on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is sickering out of the marginal zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when women's rights are threatened globally in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most dissuasive aspect of the TV series' The Hand maid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the swallowing body and the out-of-eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are slave slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the saying of 2017: maids</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they struggled for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strangely on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but it is in a further context that this also entails significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that his kittens will not be repulsed one day."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans" normalize "the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself trapped by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"if Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">Researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system.</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a nutrition tolerant of tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, investigated a kind of immune cell that fostered tolerance, when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was accommodated separately did not have this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they did not have an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerating cells as mice and that most of us are protecting L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2676">"back then, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the area of refurbishment II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the existing renovations are a" "success project" "- it is important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the sum of the funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros come from the country, the rest of the commune."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a rehabilitation area develop?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will continue to investigate, according to Schindler, where the" "really old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the area borders could be postponed again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the contents of the" "Social City" "Confederation programme in which the restructurings would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be object-related, that is, per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would eventually be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">"since 1 January 2017, the grant period for funding runs until 30 April 2026."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the survey would only be carried out once again in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, it is planned to take place as soon as possible, so that the restructurings can begin next year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann declared that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about evaluating the urban conditions of the city and deciding when it will be renovated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"for the respective property, there will also be a remediation note in the land register."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"again, Pietzschmann will once again come to sensations and take a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">This is why questionnaires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and land arc", "in which it is possible, among other things, to the structural condition and the renovation intentions."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the gray questionnaire, the" household and apartment sheet, "information on size, layout and residents of a residential space can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "operating arc" "is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new building measures are not eligible for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of the funds according to the" greyhound principle "works - whoever comes first, admonishes first."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights US manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the military personnel left to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, built in Connecticut, was placed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military bureau of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event, his supervisor, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news indicates that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7am for the event, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note also adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second crew was needed."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states using state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "sounds as if you're locked up," "the deputy commander answered."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the" "Made in America" "event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.</seg>

<seg id="2738">"as Trump at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercise landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted on the training requirement of the flight crew for the month, said a beamer."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew 11 hours this day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers overtook the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per flight."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Unit records list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter for the event."</seg>

<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire engine car."</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen Report on the abuse of abuse is relieved by Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann believes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisndie, spokesman for the reform movement" Wir sind Kirche, "declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, expecting from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the cathedral-kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would very well serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the events at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"on the other hand, the Vatican magazine" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that when reporting on violence against the Domspatzen, it was measured with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the violations in Regensburg no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful deeds, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion about it," says Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also spoke with Bayerischer Rundfunk in an interview:" we like to go to the church, and this is a found feeding. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that" "punches were normal pedagogical means" "in her youth," "to cope with naughty children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the misuse cases, also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memory book" My Brother the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "I must take George Ratzinger into protection," "says Ezekiel," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is written in the 440 pages report, which was presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber of the diocese of Regensburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen has been sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other defendants, however, many casualties have been estimated that many victims rated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories with him in many cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion relieved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violence of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as cholereriker and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you do the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"he has just eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or co-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can at best prevent him from getting out of it too late or not having taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium in which he worked was felt by practically all surveyors - literally -" "redemption," "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"this is how the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger provide an excellent testimony, describing him as" warm, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" honest, "" competent "and" understanding "as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and" always been encamped by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotional appeal, which also led to quarries."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only kneel with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also condemned ear-cowardly and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself had already admitted many years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"it must be said, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the period between the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know these methods of cultivation?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced that in a secular school, a state grammar school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"in comparison to what actually is in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are certainly bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders whether it is not with his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media fell on him straight."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report reported a great deal on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger is also accused of any involvement or co-knowing with regard to sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: definitely not.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have become familiar with the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said an affected representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally to a certain extent."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Ratzinger Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in relation to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student expressed this: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that reckoned with him... beards are intrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the pupils and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any shared responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be blamed for not preventing or displaying it."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, there was a lot of" "violent excesses" "among the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of being" "Weggating" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed and mixed up in the reporting became a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but that is precisely what, in turn, is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, there is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and abuse of violence as well as, let us say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report treats incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral director of the Cathedral Sparrows."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were properly victimized and maligned and suffered from them, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral-sparing gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most witnesses stress, the subject" preschool, "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">We were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisical" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the dome gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported to him by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school at which he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger read his ears consistently before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that" in the pre-school, the punishment would continue to be practiced. ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test penalties in Bavaria had long been banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they acquired themselves in a legal grey area, as each one of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the corporal punishment in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis stated, that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of judging the past in accordance with today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, and also not for what was faded in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all really horrible and I am glad that it will finally work out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"in the 1970s, his means for disciplining and punishment, so as to draw ear-figs and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was banned, he was strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburger time did Georg Ratzinger read in the talks with you for the book" "My Brother the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test sentence also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-trance institution, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candies one does not once again make a great singer and a success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, groundbreaking, deeply believing and heart-good people, of whom one could not imagine that he could only do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his resettlement, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly among them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the Domspatzen is grateful to him that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look up today and worship them downright."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clear: all that you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which has just been published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the lawyer would command a 93-year-old man, who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally leaving in peace."</seg>
